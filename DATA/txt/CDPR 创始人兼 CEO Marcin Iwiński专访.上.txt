Text:  um uh， the stuff uh i was totally fascinated。 i mean， amega was it was one of the one of the best gaming machine uh i had。 and then after a couple of years that was already high school，, Start Time: 457170
Text:  obviously， i got into APC。 and and like i practically state until today with the PC， although it's slightly better and a little bit faster these days，, Start Time: 469630
Text:  probably like a couple thousand times。 these HII made a lot of international contacts。 i was on the BBS of the building board system scene。, Start Time: 478190
Text:  i was i was changing software。 i was trading um at that time in poland， we didn't have a puperright law。 so um actually any any way uh was like emerging from the deep socialism，, Start Time: 489020

Text:  uh um h computing forward， and then the CD wrong came and southern， you know， six hundred fifty megabbytes on one media。 so i started II got all my safeings the couple hundred dollars and HI imported，, Start Time: 572170
Text:  probably one of the first six gmps to polent with some software。 and um h the point point few games just to play and me have so them。, Start Time: 585090
Text:  uh， we started talking about if we go totally into it。 uh games， which were from the very beginning using the graphics uh and and the audio，, Start Time: 594150
Text:  which was possible to fit on the cd room。 i still remember it。 it was the seven gaguest h was incredible game， and actually， we have it on GOG dot com uh and mad docmc creree。, Start Time: 603730
Text:  uh。 so um that was from american laser games。 uh uuh a company from new mexico that was uh uh was doing ing huge coin up cabinet。, Start Time: 616740
Text:  um uh pretty much parts of digitizmovies es were roling ling。 and then depending on arming， if you were shooting at the guy and you shoot him successfully，, Start Time: 627360
Text:  then another piece of the of the dimedized material， like the scene where he's falling from the roof， something like diccessful laer。, Start Time: 637820
Text:  if you remember this one， uh。 so this were the first things， and we immediately immediately thought that woh。 um i have contacts me how me how um h pretty good that selling things。, Start Time: 644720
Text:  and he had uh a few boots on the local gaming market。 so i started importing the games and me have ll started selling ers ah， had beone super successful because hehad the first import of to notice that city roonare the the the big glofor。, Start Time: 657570
Text:  ah ah three months after we started the company。 i mean， it sounds big， but it was just too guys because yeah， yeah， yeah， starara big because because he starting big company，, Start Time: 673050
Text:  because means you have silly silly good valley。 venture capital is giving you millions of dollars。 we had one old。 we had one old pc and how had two thousand dollars。, Start Time: 685550
Text:  and ah his friend gagave us a room for free， the cense of of so on a very high ford floor。 yeah， we started silting games。 so um we 're importing the quantity between one and two units per title，, Start Time: 695430
Text:  not to get with uh over stoks。 and it was also feeding in in one tiny， um dining case。 and that was the whole business， but it was selling like hot cakes。, Start Time: 709610
Text:  and uh it was a dreink dream coming true。 because first of all， we had， uh we had good business。 we're able to make money for uh h just you know，, Start Time: 721500
Text:  having fun and relaxing where we 're young guys just started stuarying。 yeah。 and then second think we had access to all the latest games。, Start Time: 730960
Text:  uh， i still remember i found somewhere。 uh uh， i all of an old， and i probably one of the first we at and working hours room from ten，, Start Time: 738500
Text:  ten to four PM。 and i started laughing when i thought because i thought that probably from four PM， we were playing to early morning all against your importting。, Start Time: 748620
Text:  uh， that's how it all started。 um okay。 so so if that's because your business is mainly like the the city ruong uh focus。 so that's why you call your company city project。, Start Time: 756900
Text:  right？ exactly， okay， i see。 so um so before you really start producing games。 uh。 uh you uh， you started your business under such uh condition。, Start Time: 768940
Text:  and you know um um um so when did you like decide you， you know， you know， produce games yourself， you know the game you want to produce and and you know，, Start Time: 783690
Text:  and before you made such a decision， um how much do you know about such a industry？ the the video game industry。 ok， okay， it was um you know，, Start Time: 795570
Text:  the dream was always that since we started playing games with me， how um in in high gone， we are actually known for skipping gastogether with playing games together。, Start Time: 805590
Text:  ok， the many teacers ers told this。 yeah wow， you always are ababat the same time。 how come come yesay？ yeah， you know， we have some other things。, Start Time: 815750
Text:  things do you and tell them we're playing games back in the gaames ames， where we are very nervthings think you like， okay， yeah，, Start Time: 825290
Text:  no normal people where didn't normal， what the plames games。 uh。 so it was always a dream， but you know， we are realistic。 yeah，, Start Time: 831930
Text:  we didn't know how to do games， but most all we didn't have money。 any money would nice sowever。 you know， the two thousand notes of our initial capitry yeum lets through monmonth，, Start Time: 841730
Text:  maybe you know， will grow it。 um so we thought， okay， well will start with this。 well will grow。 it will start making money and actually would uh，, Start Time: 849890
Text:  six or seven years， we became the major false in games distribution in in poland and then central europe es。 so poland checks tobacca hungry ah ah uh business business grew to to to to quite a nice scale。, Start Time: 861550
Text:  and only then decidecided would start uuh doing our own games when we are able to funit properly。 but obviously， it it didn't happen，, Start Time: 876050
Text:  like， you know， super conscious decision。 yes， we have the capital in the bank。 and yes， tomorrow， games wasn't like that。 um it was actually，, Start Time: 885610
Text:  i think good card myself to speaker um b 嗯嗯， and uh and certain unforeseen events coming together uh at the certain ly time at a certain place we went，, Start Time: 894270
Text:  we are distributing one of the one of the companies we are distributing among the others was intertapland。 and um you know， the hayday of interplay，, Start Time: 906740

Text:  and the game was just looking basing。 they showed as the presentation was more more like an action opp g think it was developed by snowblind studios。, Start Time: 982390
Text:  it was really looking gorgeous at that time。 and at the end， the the presversion was them。 um and so guys one is the PC version coming，, Start Time: 989690
Text:  and it's was hey， there is no PC version。 it we like a outcomes。 but uh uh we we we we they knew， and obviously， uh， we kvery well well，, Start Time: 996050
Text:  the publishsh market was idon't on ninety five and PC。 so they were coming just with the PS two version。 we wouldn't have much salout out of it。, Start Time: 1009420
Text:  and it would be， you know， a hupuputting going to wawastso。 we 're thinking the whole day。 and in the evening， we we started talking with guguys and said，, Start Time: 1016480
Text:  eh， if you want APC version， make it yourself。 and and we said， okay， uh， rather think about it。 uh after after we we we flew to interplay europe in london。, Start Time: 1025600
Text:  they actually gave us APS to death kit。 i think we still have it summer。 we flew back。 yeah， we flew back。 we smuggled it。 we smuggled it in the back。, Start Time: 1038120
Text:  we would you have any papers for it。 and at the time， poland was not part of the EU。 we control was lokininst street。 yeah， we found AA guy who had some technology，, Start Time: 1047980
Text:  and he made a shooter in the past and just just a local game in the big ast。 and he said， a oy l， good for for ah he started and probably after a month to the interplay europe，, Start Time: 1058920
Text:  people， callers and said， hey， you know， the situation of the company doesn't look too well。 doesn't look good。 good h， nobody will pay。, Start Time: 1070110
Text:  you don't send the agement and beforget about it。 keep the death t just available， and we mebeen honestly and that the time when interplay started really falling apart ah ah of all the the app voyeah ah know the play still there。, Start Time: 1076670
Text:  but but it's just a couple of people in all the opi ement， but that was actually the demise of interplay that the beginning。 and but that was actually the the play was，, Start Time: 1090150
Text:  you know， the power house of all the the opp gies。 yeah ah ah ah ah of all the big p oneoah。 so you know know the the we sort of called the igntion at that。, Start Time: 1098690
Text:  i'm disparkle there， then we started thinking， okay， and we have it already。 i mean， we started working。 we we the guguy， uuh， HH and somesomebod's 's the，, Start Time: 1110590
Text:  the， the reof of the， the which yeah available。 um ah ah ah just to put it into perspective， what the witicher is imppoland， the polish name is viageme。, Start Time: 1121650
Text:  yeah。 and uh， it's based on a series of books。 and uh， i'm of courcourkey the author who created it um for us， he's talking。 so any polish person you ask about the ijmin？, Start Time: 1131580
Text:  they'll tell you， wow viijmin， i know it。 and most of them en ad it。 so so wasasn't， you know， know ababbing uh， intellectual property work。, Start Time: 1144490
Text:  it was like working on the coled cled thing。 i to remember when i read the first story about three guard。 so so so just in high school and know know he told the in a science fiction monmonly ah amazing amazing stuff。, Start Time: 1154230
Text:  and then you know， we had the opportunity to work on it。 we， we bob， the rights and started working。 we started working with the guy uh stside of also。, Start Time: 1167510
Text:  and and i think arted， uh， like for people um and we plan to to make a huge RPG uwe staling up to fifteen people。 we had like fifteen people up to be huge stube the'll all do it。, Start Time: 1174870
Text:  so so so just just again， to put it in perccting， we had no bloody clue how to make games。 and however， uafter， after a year of development，, Start Time: 1189550
Text:  luckily， you know， it was ght just four people outside the wars。 it was cheaper。 so it wasn't a big because we we we had a tag demalo。, Start Time: 1201080
Text:  it was like a location tion， and ah we went around using our distribution contact。 so you know， we distributed most most the gaming company。, Start Time: 1208400
Text:  so we knew all the right people。 i mean， we we we knew have to do business。 we met the right people and after a two weeks tore around europe um because you know，, Start Time: 1218080
Text:  back in the day， there wasn't digital distributions。 so we really had to talbecause。 but after after the guys would be calall them。, Start Time: 1228420
Text:  and yeah， we had we call them the gatekeeper。 yes， if you didn't have a publisher， you are not able to to get your game to gamers，, Start Time: 1235380
Text:  because the only way to get your game， two gamers ers most to put it on the shelers and the the stores， all the eeropand and know we consequently all eeper and the guguys at the publishers that were，, Start Time: 1243360
Text:  they were deciding if the game will make it or not， but but the decithings in a green light cometes。 yes， but but we taltalk to just yeah the gatekeepers，, Start Time: 1256900
Text:  we just talk to the gatekeeper ers。 and after the two weeweeks， we got two emails， after i think like ten meeting and the emails were were written in a very nice icly，, Start Time: 1266260
Text:  polite english。 and pretty much the the meaning was that it's it's really not good enough。 and we're like， oh， it yeah。 yes， we saw it's our dream，, Start Time: 1274950
Text:  but um we're always quite stubborso。 so first， we started talking to the guy um to move him to worse。 so and the main problem we had was the technology because it was his proprieatoral technology，, Start Time: 1284550
Text:  and he didn't want any else to touch it。 so the first bar year we had is that he is just one。 there's just one programmer working，, Start Time: 1297970
Text:  and there's no way the'll be more。 so i think we talk for a monn or something。 and then we said okwe， we got apart always， uh， we actually went to the city。, Start Time: 1305430
Text:  uh we pked， we remove the people， remove three people。 he he staed there， he said， okay， i'm not doing anything with me more。 and and we started working on the graphics on the design in wars or already so in our offices。, Start Time: 1314250
Text:  so actually， the studio started it in a warehouse， we cut out a part of our warehouse and put guguys there。 so it was in n't really nice，, Start Time: 1328840
Text:  nice place， yeah。 and then very， very， very short time after towards where the three and and we were walking around and the weshole there was the biyer。, Start Time: 1337020
Text:  but and the past where they would be ted all of their gaames。 and and we full ly alialize ed， and it 'll logaate。 we knew them we were in touch and ah and we came buy their boot and asked the question，, Start Time: 1346760
Text:  tion y yeah and then know have dissenging the agrange and and yeah youdidn't licenence it ah to anyone。 maybe if we 'loalized and we you to licence it to us and they scratchch their hts。, Start Time: 1355680
Text:  and and ah ah it's good your asking king， because we 're just thinking about licence sing their engine， let's give it a try。 so they give us the technology。, Start Time: 1367480
Text:  probably a two weeks later， we start ted walking and we the couple of months to sign agreement。 but so ort of sort of magically，, Start Time: 1373780
Text:  but we came into position of technology， which enable us to prepare a property within within two monmonth and and h and and the the ethree，, Start Time: 1381560
Text:  after this one， where we ask for the technology， uh， we actually they invited us to have a place add their boot any three。 so um by our uh in a way，, Start Time: 1391770
Text:  was helping us to show our game。 we had a place in the corner。 there were showing uh a huge game of there's。 at that time。 it was jay empire。, Start Time: 1404910
Text:  it was an exbox you and the ginal， yeah， the original laxbooks exclusive because we we in the corcorner。 so they were like having all lilike ggfor，, Start Time: 1412670

Text:  i'm ounundiing bbit， but they have this game this this school game， the which ter， you know， i really like wh。 we have all this all this media and and and h has really giving us a kick start。, Start Time: 1434770
Text:  and we actually had a very， very positive response， because， you know， thanks to the to the literature of of founderies， of course，, Start Time: 1446390
Text:  thanks to the books， we had a very solid substance to build upon。 and one of the thanks to the yeah， very like corner stones of of the whole，, Start Time: 1454190
Text:  which ure world is that we have actually uh been very um very um direcct with bringing uthe fuel of the book to the game。 so it's it's very green and very mature from the very beginning。, Start Time: 1464660
Text:  we wanted to make a game from mature audience。 i mean， these days you see see， like， i don't know if you you you for sure， watch game of trones。, Start Time: 1478840
Text:  yes， but right now， everybody loved game of tronons。 but when they started broadcasting， people were in a shock， how comes a one of the heroes can die？, Start Time: 1486100
Text:  it was unusual before， you know， it was all sweet。 it was more like a very taillish canor， but you know， the the big RPG games back in the day，, Start Time: 1495500
Text:  like dangions and dragons。 it was all very， very candy， like i ah um candy， like no romance， and you know， and suddenly hugagame of trance or the which ture you have sacgs，, Start Time: 1505040

Text:  and but so um um so we we now we have uh large series of questions about richer。 you know， the the video game whicher， yeah and h these day。, Start Time: 1598480
Text:  you know， it's it's really popular， popular sentencing china。 yeah， i didn't that today。 would you like the game？ would you like to play grinwith with us？, Start Time: 1611260
Text:  it's everyeverything。 it's like like it's it's like it's just like like know， know like the the eldest growth about the yrem。 you know，, Start Time: 1621060
Text:  it's like because once was was adventure like you until i got really error on my kece。 um it's something really popular even。 you know some some guys，, Start Time: 1631800
Text:  they don't play video games， but they know with the sentence， would you like some grint？ and so uh so so that really uh， they really there are lots of questions about the richer。, Start Time: 1640660
Text:  and so um you you mention that you were， you were a reader of the rich at the novel when you were in in high school。 so like um and and and so you start to making this game and and but we can see that the first uh，, Start Time: 1652290
Text:  the first game， the first richer game。 it's like， you know， you know， it's like， well， it's like a medium like sicied world and uuuh h，, Start Time: 1669530
Text:  you know， was a limited areas designs， you know， different stages。 we have liloof stages ges。 we go between different stages ges。, Start Time: 1681570
Text:  we have you have the loading screen over there。 and then we got to， you know， the second theies， the second ture， two， the assassing of kings，, Start Time: 1689650
Text:  and then we have， like different stages， the first stagin flotson， the second stage， like we have two loading the chapters， yeah，, Start Time: 1699670
Text:  yeah， the chapters， different chapters。 and and then we we come to the third one， then we have like massive open world sandboxes。, Start Time: 1707450
Text:  and then it seeen that the world of the game， which is uh you know in larging， you know， one after one in bogame。 and so uh so what you like，, Start Time: 1716050
Text:  do you think this kind of you know this kind because it means a larger game， probably means more efforts more strength， more uh investments in the game。, Start Time: 1726420
Text:  so would you think this kind of efforts you know to make this game better and better， you know， make the world large and larger a risky decision？, Start Time: 1737280
Text:  do you think it's really risky to do so？ and and if you think there is kind of risks over there， you know why why did you still like want to want to have a try？, Start Time: 1745660
Text:  yeah， but but you know， i think uh， i should actually i should actually reviad this question， and i should ask you and do you think it？, Start Time: 1757005
Text:  it was worth it？ well， definitely， absolutely， it is worse。 okay， okay。 and i think， and i think uh， you get your answer here。 no，, Start Time: 1768910
Text:  no， no， no， but i can。 okay。 i'll give you， but i wanted to to provoke kay。 yeah， i think II think， you know， uh， ultimately it。, Start Time: 1778800
Text:  we we are trying some things， and if we wouldn't try， it would be boring and it wouldn't be ambitious。 and i think we wouldn't be who we are。, Start Time: 1793700
Text:  so um we always always try try to do new things。 and i think it's the nature of of uh AA ast majority of the developers， and maybe they improve some parts of the game，, Start Time: 1801920
Text:  improve mechanics。 but um this， this is the nature ure， the creators to make things better better to delinew things， things。 and um as as as you see and actually，, Start Time: 1812980
Text:  i think you you you describe the the sort of development or development of our development first corcorrectly。 uh as they say， wrong wasn't built in the day。, Start Time: 1823250
Text:  um and uh uh i think it's it's really important。 so if you look what uh we have achieved in the last uh ten years shows that we were very brave from the beginning，, Start Time: 1837340
Text:  but we we we never really decived to the uh inours。 yes， we never said， hi YH。 it's good enough。 let's leave it as it is。 let's make um h is three，, Start Time: 1849980
Text:  the same as which are two， i think still， you know， probably which it was a great game， and it was which are one。 but uh if if uh i talk with in the studio，, Start Time: 1860340
Text:  for example， at a certain point， uh， we had some HS。 uh， hey， maybe we should take these two games to the new consolsee。 yes， i mean，, Start Time: 1871030
Text:  obvily， but then which which one one， it's super harart that maybe which too， but then a lot of people in the studio， say， road that they are a part of who you were back in the day。, Start Time: 1880910
Text:  we are different。 now。 we want to do new things。 ah， we we know more。 we are more experiences。 so if see see which which one the main challenge，, Start Time: 1893870
Text:  but after first informhey make make game me continuation that that's that's first first challenge。 but ok， we've never made a game。, Start Time: 1903690
Text:  yeah。 so so let's make one。 let's make it as good as we can。 yeah。 and on top of we're using somebody else this technology， but at the beginning was great，, Start Time: 1911330
Text:  but after five years of development， we've actually uh have written around ninety percent of the roal engine code。 so what we had was a kind of monistercity。, Start Time: 1921550
Text:  it was ten percent of the original code and backbone nineteen percent of our code。 yeah， the technology already when we licensed the the engine wasn't one of the US。, Start Time: 1932230
Text:  so you know， the sort of the procesors， where multiple ore starting to be multicore。 and then the whole engine was like， you know，, Start Time: 1942030
Text:  when we know this working a built， um we have to really put it together in a very uh librariies way， using different tricks and sometimes even hacks。, Start Time: 1949330
Text:  so to speak to make it work ah because it wasn't automatical cookers。 so okay， so was was the first um um we the gagaum。 um targeted more at the at the core audience。, Start Time: 1961170
Text:  ah ah we wanted to be the beginning。 it was was very well ved。 ah。 we started to learn how to do good storytelink。 and then you can see the evolution in which are so then which is do to have first of our our technolology right dengyeah in ish PC than extrthree sixty um because of the problems of the architecture of the PS three back in today。, Start Time: 1975130
Text:  yeah， would it taking us way too much time to make APS three version？ and also， the constle was less powerful？ i think it it really it really was tough。, Start Time: 1998100
Text:  we didn't want to disappoint it and sunny game and is play。 hey， games as we said， like， hey guys， i mean， if we have to work another year and sacrifice the quality，, Start Time: 2006980
Text:  i think it would sasappoint everyone。 let's pasass it it and t's t's ve onto， which lling so and which you you。 so what you can see is，, Start Time: 2016160
Text:  you know， uh， look at the difference， how the story is talght， yes， what kind of cinematic way of storytelling， where using the close up s，, Start Time: 2022540
Text:  the dialogues， the small little gestures？ yes。 so and of course， you know， our lives in wasn't perfect。 this wasn't perfect tly that but the game was was was at a different level。, Start Time: 2032120
Text:  yeah， also， if you see see again。 and uh， we we took a certain creawe， maybe the creative for is。 but definitely uh， some people would say if we waasted a lot of money and a lot of development time，, Start Time: 2041860
Text:  because the the the the central chapter， you can play you two， depending ding。 yeah， but we side you chose。 yeah， which d you choose yemally，, Start Time: 2057010
Text:  you know， uh uh h good well， uh uh financially optimize publishare。 we probabably adandle it。 uh as ADLC， we we said y we would abwe think it's cool because people will uh people will uh repay most probababand acacquite ite few few of them。, Start Time: 2067730
Text:  you can。 and then with which ch it three， when you okay， we have the technology。 now ah we really learn how to how to do the story，, Start Time: 2086450
Text:  telling the technology is our proprieatorory technology for our RPG games。 that's really， really important。 but with which it to be，, Start Time: 2095890
Text:  of course， with the next generation， we spend a lot of time with attack， but we are just taking it to the next level and not doing the basic。, Start Time: 2103070
Text:  so uh， huge part of the team， they not doing the basleso。 um i'm doing the cool story dodoing the quest。 so that's that's what you see think think that's really what what ool is after。, Start Time: 2109530
Text:  yeah ah think think gragraphics are are very important。 but even if the graphics would be all bit worse， and the story would still be great and engaging。, Start Time: 2121270
Text:  they would love it。 that's what why people play RPG games， at least that's how we see it。 and then which which three is just just，, Start Time: 2128370
Text:  you know the the final accomplishment， so h terthink， which the which just just ah we at the same time， the closure to girl ststory。, Start Time: 2136510
Text:  so so i think it fit it it well， because what we just it， i think would would， which to we just wouldn't be able to make an open world game，, Start Time: 2144910
Text:  and i'm glad youare taking maybe not one one step at time time， but only ten steps at at time， not not a stesteps at it。 okay。 good，, Start Time: 2152760
Text:  thank you know know no， next quesqueswould， be you。 you see ah now nowadays， a lot of games um seems like sandbox and opopen world，, Start Time: 2162640
Text:  the most popolar of the popular， you know， you know， direction of the know of the game design these days。 and so so what do you think it'll like a very good tendency or not？, Start Time: 2173280
Text:  i you know， um i'm always i'm always when i very II play games， and i don't play as much as i used to um also because sorry to say，, Start Time: 2186325
Text:  but IA lot of i find a lot of games was boring。 um if if it's if it's more of the same staff， another open world， just for the sake of having it，, Start Time: 2196930
Text:  it don't see， see a purpose。 just you know， i think there is a certain purpose， what you want to acurpose。 if if it's good for prourgame，, Start Time: 2208090
Text:  if it's a living in breeding world， i don't let t's say， let's II。 don't read the rediction of gt。 a， ah， it makes perfect sense。, Start Time: 2215970
Text:  yes， this game in a nno opal al world， it be。 it wouldn't be that good it。 it be a future experience。 you wouldn't feel the freedom。, Start Time: 2222730
Text:  you wouldn't wouldn't feel really， yes。 in this world as a as a vital part of it。 and if it's a very much our would take， we serve you an open living in breeding world and tell a story in this world。, Start Time: 2232670
Text:  yes， this game as we created the game。 i think it's also very important to stress it。 that's also very， very d to acworld you world。, Start Time: 2246610
Text:  not， hey， let's create the world and then put a stories。 so if i see a game like that or games like that， and there's quite few of them，, Start Time: 2255950
Text:  then i asking king yself self。 so so what is interesting stopping here， but probably not i'm not flying。 so uum that's how i see。, Start Time: 2264140
Text:  i think no， obviously， game is demand more freedom， but but but you know nothing what certain glling。 um i don't not look， for example that II really like story tetelling games。, Start Time: 2272620
Text:  so ststytelling。 so i look at the tail tail stop。 yes。 um i'm a huge fan of what they did it working that and the world for among gand。, Start Time: 2285920
Text:  so is a far from what anyone near open work。 it's it's on rails， but i like it is a good story telling。 so uum if it serves a purpose，, Start Time: 2292860
Text:  yes， but but the first question is， but that is this open work。 and what is it giving me as a gaming experience doesn't make sense。, Start Time: 2302400
Text:  so okay。 so um when you are producing， which are three， um um are there any like incident that you know has have happened， which really influence um really influenced the the publish the publishment of the game，, Start Time: 2310540
Text:  you know？ and also， you know， the whole development of the game， you know， anything crucial impimportant series， okay。 i think i think even even even well control gaindevelopment，, Start Time: 2327450
Text:  what which i believe our is is one big walking accident。 yeah。 uh and uh uh especiwhen， when you have next chance in the picture，, Start Time: 2340730
Text:  yeah， you're coming， not that far from the launch。 uh i think it's it's just one big working progress。 you know um ah yeah， the released the game was was hardly working on any consolved code，, Start Time: 2351160
Text:  and then we just spent ages and optimizing it and pushing the max。 and um you know， the accicidenyou know one day day tell us it runs on um two frames per second，, Start Time: 2365060
Text:  um and real like holly crop and the on watch concert。 yeah， i will。 i will not name the name。 i say， i say， okay， actually franank speaking king to the irrelevant。, Start Time: 2377705
Text:  i can answer on both yeah， then and then you know， and then for one month， they have an increase， right？ i know a few friends per second，, Start Time: 2392100
Text:  and we are like， oh， my god， and then something happens over the weecan， like guy comes with a genius。 ID fixes two box， uh pushes an optimization。, Start Time: 2399840
Text:  and it runs it ah twenty two。 and you know。 so i think this is the nature of of games development。 it's it's uh， it's it's very experimental。, Start Time: 2409240
Text:  it's and you have to have， uh， very， very strong nerth。 yeah ah ah yeah， it's it's outit's， a real custody， right？ uh tistispeyeah。, Start Time: 2420020
Text:  ah okay， uh， so we will now come back to this little bit you。 ah we have frananlot of serious questions。 sorry， and and that's it's this this a onyeh。, Start Time: 2431280
Text:  yeah， enjoyable to talk about。 it's uh， well， as we have mention that。 uh we uh， it's it's really a popular culture of phenomenon about the card games grent。, Start Time: 2443060
Text:  in your your me， um in the， which are three china， even lolot of people in china。 even don't call your game， which are three。 they call that grint three。, Start Time: 2456030
Text:  and and so uh， why did you？ uh so uh uh， could you could you share us some stories when you are designing such a you know， minor card game inside such a you know，, Start Time: 2464330
Text:  a which a world。 and and and so uh when uh， for what reason did you decide to， you know， to add such a uh interesting little game inside this massive open world game，, Start Time: 2477870
Text:  you know， the the originally uh in the which al law。 yeah， there is no grint。 there is it's our， it's our， it's our inventions。, Start Time: 2489685
Text:  it's that there is some there is some game in the toverns。 i do ing number， what it is originally。 there is， of course， face fithing，, Start Time: 2498200
Text:  it's called by raw or something。 there's a game。 yeah， i rase right？ yeah。 yeah。 yeah， that ah there is one uum， and then we want it，, Start Time: 2506000
Text:  obviously to make something cool， adding some cool mechanics， uh， which blends in very well with the stories。 you can see， you know，, Start Time: 2515550
Text:  the fiice fighting um if taking to the next next one。 and actually that， that's also part of a sort of minstghor， which i'm enjoying it about。, Start Time: 2522610
Text:  and then you can blend it with the story line。 so you have challenges， you have quest。 you think people people like to be challengge constantly。, Start Time: 2529810
Text:  and if you if you add out different kinds of challenges in an orp g， so not only like he do dispquise the that quequefollow the story ory。, Start Time: 2537570
Text:  i think someone but suddenly become the master of of of going inbebecome， the mter ter of offfifight。 i think think it's spicing things up。, Start Time: 2546650
Text:  and um i can tell you the story of grint uh and actually， i will send you an article afterwaruuh uh h， which was published that the the two creators，, Start Time: 2555150
Text:  uh creators of of going to are talking about it。 so oh， ah adam， adam， adam， but those key ahead of the studio， but um h wanted to have another game。, Start Time: 2567100
Text:  but uh， we 're running out of time。 so uh， that was the there was uh concept of something utitively simple， but uuh， one of our concepors，, Start Time: 2580320
Text:  uh deamon monium。 so uh， he said， no， no， give me a weekend。 i'm together with were together with drafle yakee who's serves our business studier，, Start Time: 2590460
Text:  but he's he's also helping designing the game and he's also total tal bberneert as far so th games are concerned。 so whaever， we have a question。, Start Time: 2600100
Text:  we go and ask crafle， and uh， they both said， no adam， adam， please give us the weekend hehe's。 um uh he gathem the weeweeend end on monday。, Start Time: 2610820
Text:  they came uh with cards cut out of just regular paper， and they， they played the game in front of him。 and he said he was actually about to cont it before the weekend。, Start Time: 2620870
Text:  he said about gpoint it， and he was like the the game me for it。 and and said， no， i like the game go for it。 and that's the whole story of grint。, Start Time: 2632610
Text:  and ah so it's and it's not uh great thing， great thing。 and the consomet of for it， it was the weekend， of course， it was in polant it and and not was uh total，, Start Time: 2640590
Text:  you know， card game of fish and others。 and ah they came uh the concert t of grand and and then expanded it。 and then it became really，, Start Time: 2654390
Text:  really vital part of the whole， which experience， yes， yes。 and and was the the name grant。 actually， we have find out out and out that actually ally apout like memedivovoking，, Start Time: 2663730
Text:  the apand， yes whales。 and so why do you decide to to name such a game gin？ i actually II actually don't know。 i don't know that oh，, Start Time: 2676590
Text:  can sull you can so just let me um let me find find word the words um home 哼 uh in polish。 um the name because polish name is not good about the gfet。, Start Time: 2688440
Text:  um GWINT like the name。 it's it's it's it's pretty much with the still still part of the screw which you screw on。 that's the ookay say，, Start Time: 2707960
Text:  i say， like a well sh name something something ah ah ah II can up， i'm how they can name。 okay， yeah for me， it was an automatic canof，, Start Time: 2722040
Text:  like i got it， and i didn't ask youwas like ccool name。 okay， kay， so it's it's a kind of angle fight in english to it， to be ginor。, Start Time: 2733680
Text:  actually probably that looks like a wish name or something。 yeah， okay， okay， cool。 so have you ever considered or ah you know an IOS version or grint？, Start Time: 2743100
Text:  yeah， and also adding APVP on that's know the quesquesis is。 is that know？ i mean， you know， um of course， after the bus delion of femails es uh considered。, Start Time: 2753280
Text:  but uh it's it's it's too too too early taltalk about it。 ah HI can say it it because you know know ah， if if if they would ever be a multiplay version sion and what it it will have to come from us because h know a lot of people try to do it because they ask us if they can do it，, Start Time: 2768680
Text:  because uh， we cannot really give people all this doessay。 hey， go and run with。 and uuh h。 it is a very important part of the witch。, Start Time: 2787960
Text:  and because uh we destroit that the the the witter experience it， even if it's happening outside of it， because obviously， they would want to use uh the character they want to the car。, Start Time: 2799080
Text:  and what know sisidon't don't forget that you know， h mumultiplay grin is a totally different beast than the single stain。 if is having the game，, Start Time: 2809380
Text:  which is designing for it， so it it really works well。 is it going toward more quilling multiplayer？ you know， the， we'll see full decide to make one。, Start Time: 2818440
Text:  okay， okay， so about that。 uh。 so uh can we say that most of the development of the the richer three is only you know， happened within you the CD project。, Start Time: 2830595
Text:  however， you know， like， you know， invited some， yeah， yeah， for some free freelance teams to to do pots with the game。 you， you know，, Start Time: 2845010
Text:  i mean， we had uh， i think it would be best for you to look at the super long ddit， because uthere， there were really hundreds，, Start Time: 2854880
Text:  hundreds and hundreds of people ah， but game me self the whoall core game done in house。 we had the whole support from outside uah。, Start Time: 2864160
Text:  ah HH quality， surance， ance of hundds， of of uh， i think we really believe to deliver this kind kind ququality the hall um core creation of the story of the programming of the graphics of dost。, Start Time: 2874800
Text:  it has to be of the design。 it has to be in house onside uh because we we uah guarantee the harmony that all works with each other and then that it makes all logical sense for the game and within the world afterwards。, Start Time: 2891680
Text:  and the englistties HH know。 it's it's it's way way easiit's。 it's it's it's happening ing。 we're so importookcooooooh ay， okay，, Start Time: 2907280
Text:  so so partly partly partly small partles done one。 so by hours to the crack， but but know that they are part our our team。 yeah，, Start Time: 2915600
Text:  yeah yeah ah， just three hundred kilkilometers away， that's it。 okay， i see。 okay。 so we have also notice， uh that's h， that's ah uh h that's like the english accent。, Start Time: 2923240
Text:  you know， in the english version of which are three that that differentiated ooay。 so HH the koundlike different kingdoms， you are from the northern kingdoms，, Start Time: 2935140
Text:  different sounds like party the titish， accient and scoatticga。 they sounds like ourish or portish， you know， these， the outish accent。, Start Time: 2943960
Text:  so and the new new lish of our think h。 it's a very foreign english accent since they don't speak the common town in northern kingdoms。, Start Time: 2951520
Text:  and so you have differentiated all these accents in the english version。 so does such kind of differentiation exist in the in in the polish。, Start Time: 2961210
Text:  you know， guguverversion， actually， uh， it's a very good question。 you're asking me。 there is certain differentiation， but i think um uh，, Start Time: 2971410
Text:  it huh polen is not so they diversified in terms of acaccts。 yeah ah， you have i'm in in polish language。 so it's it's much harder to achieve。, Start Time: 2981330
Text:  i really enjoyed a police version， but it felt say， uh， college also in terms of vaccts。 uh， english fastion。 it's it's probably better because it's uh culturally makes sense se about today diversifiy。, Start Time: 2991770
Text:  and yeah， and if by foreigners like you guys are like me it， it is easier to to appreciated and get it and understanding with。 we publilition wouldn't make much sense uh and and and actually both both polish and english verariations that they politen at the same time。, Start Time: 3007700
Text:  so it's not really translation。 it's more like a cultural relationas we writing。 uh HH know know if you look at the sophistication of jokes and um and the and the metaphors and the urelarelations，, Start Time: 3026240
Text:  both pollture phenomenon。 yeah， yeah， it's a very sophisticated writing， which has to be perfect in every single version。 yeah，, Start Time: 3044700
Text:  trtrstation tion。 it's trousy the game。 it's pretty much crop because you you， you， you you experience something something that's not true for yeyeah。, Start Time: 3052970
Text:  ah。 so really， really， really， i mean the whole localilation slascultural adaptation process ah ah had fourteen language version。, Start Time: 3061490
Text:  it was ah yeah yeah。 it was a gigiantic ic accomplishment。 really。 yeah。 it was a practically all of them。 well， well， had one in house，, Start Time: 3068810
Text:  accorordinated in house with exception。 i think of of japanese and maybe one more um including the traditional chinese。 and that's another reason why this game is very properly in china。, Start Time: 3077950
Text:  now yeah， and we really really reciate such such kind of effort。 yeah ah it helthe， how was the？ how was the translation？ how was the translation？, Start Time: 3088470
Text:  yeah yeah， it's ah ah yeah yeah。 yeah。 it's to the most power personally really ah ah it's it's really， really well ah ah it's really，, Start Time: 3098270
Text:  really， really， you know， yes。 do you know have you ever heard about this that you know， ah the name me of the horse， the garoo's horse is is roach，, Start Time: 3107150
Text:  right？ and and so um that roach， i think it's it's named after a kind of fish in the lake。 right？ yeah。 yeah， yeah， because they just translation。, Start Time: 3116460
Text:  yeah， yeah， the serious horse is named after crack horse。 it's carrt。 yeah ah ah ah chering at creatures， and you know the chinese translation of the the name of horse is carrot。, Start Time: 3127840
Text:  yes， carrot because not fish preproach， because that kind of fish is not really so uh commitseesing in china。 yeah， the serous horsing into carrot。, Start Time: 3140440
