Text: 嗯嗯， so we now have like this interesting question， it's about culture， you know， different cultures， you know， uh according to uh a loss of four asian players，, Start Time: 68395
Text:  including chinese。 uh you know， germany， sucarean players h most female characters， most female figures in the most western video games can hardly be called attractive。, Start Time: 116330
Text:  you know， four instances， if if part rently， i might mention the name ball。 well， yeah， it's like for us。 um most they have really interesting attractive personalities，, Start Time: 130760
Text:  but not appeararances， but h， but in in your game， probably only only your game as the ah the of trst。 i'm western our PG games。, Start Time: 141980
Text:  i've heard that we， uh even asian games。 yeah， mme thing。 you say the most of your female figures in in the games and very attractive。, Start Time: 153700
Text:  i'm a enry。 is it a fan of theory？ and i'm i'm a trh yeah and eninterest。 and i'm a fan of enrea。 i'm a fan of enffer。 yes， we we we ah we ght each other after we got drunk about the figure of truth is can like the asian female probabit's really，, Start Time: 166060
Text:  really the so sophisticated， uh know lololy ly detayeah。 ah ah the tracand。 i'm a figthis ooay。 yeah。 and so um it's like uum。 um why do you think this is like kind of gap between you know the the idea of you know，, Start Time: 183820
Text:  the standard of beauty in in east and west？ and uh so and also also， why are why do do you you are the design of the female figures uyour。, Start Time: 206350
Text:  your designer of the female figures are widely so widely accepted in asia。 that's a that's that's really， really a really good question。, Start Time: 220640
Text:  II think， you know， the the first uh uh uh answer uh， which comes my my mind。 this probably， you know， because polsh woman are really beautiful and tiful。, Start Time: 229850
Text:  yeah ah ah ah so you ah uh all the listeners， you know， beautiful groups come come to all。 and yeah yeah yeah。 i think actually uh，, Start Time: 240750
Text:  our our creators uum， um h， the whole character department。 they spend enormous amount of time on the detail， because you know，, Start Time: 252070
Text:  sometimes very small things， um and and appearances are one thing。 but then if we are talking， for example， about， i know serial trees yeah，, Start Time: 262090
Text:  look at appeananal。 and then um this this is just um you know， are still image。 it's the movement。 this is the gegestures facial。, Start Time: 271850
Text:  and this is the the way she wins that she smiles with with positive feelings。 yeah， this ah the game is very sential and II know something something something。, Start Time: 280810
Text:  yeah ah exthink exexactly it's sential。 and when when it makes sense for the stories also sexual， that's i think why you have positive feelings and games have positive feelings。, Start Time: 291930
Text:  it was the acts， or if you look at many other games on the characters are just got them plastic。 and ah ah you you don't develop feeling so warplplasor unless your unless you're really desperate。, Start Time: 307290
Text:  ok 是一波。 yeah。 but but i think what what what i'm trying to say， it's um look， uh， look how we build emotions in the game。 it's it's very similar to to to movies to cinematic。, Start Time: 323530
Text:  yeah ah that they're waving their hand。 uh they have certain gestures and and sometimes you know， on only given scene of a gesture，, Start Time: 343530
Text:  there was spending hours in no days。 yeah， you consider der true。 so and somese， this are beautiful model models， but then how they are animated。, Start Time: 350850
Text:  yeah ah ah HH sort of the whole animation and the whole scene talks to you， and that's what's building the relation。 yeah， look，, Start Time: 360930
Text:  for example， on the other hand， ugly yeah， look at the which ches ah h， which which are are in their game， because that the which which ers that are evil，, Start Time: 371290
Text:  they are twisted yeand。 they look and and trrotutes yeah。 and that's again， you cannot say it's you didn't have an university mature of which，, Start Time: 378790
Text:  and and if there is one， that's probably definitely not what we have have their gagabut， but they consider than which is。 so i think it's more of the way we narrate and we tell the story。, Start Time: 387410
Text:  and yeah， i think we also spend a lot of time on the models to make it。 the morreal actually are them。 but those key who uh because the head of the studio yeah and is，, Start Time: 398700
Text:  is the heart and the brain behind all that。 uh i don't on the which of one and which are too used to be our art director。 so um the the story is in a big way y told through art。, Start Time: 410060
Text:  um and i think that's very important for us。 um so we both think that we should show you and and also tell you， but but really a lot for we should show you。, Start Time: 423390
Text:  i have a very good example from another media， and i will come back for a moment。 the game of tronons jujumptthe crazy about the series，, Start Time: 436730
Text:  the TV series， because i mean， i read all the books， i love them。 yeah。 but then sometimes you see how the how the how the medium of TV can do things，, Start Time: 444510
Text:  um maybe not better， but easier and make them more。 um more important for you relate to you more like， i remember， i was reading a scene on couple of pages。, Start Time: 455420
Text:  yeah， until you land is it's it's siso。 yeah， around the table and talking to the little um council。 yeah， a little council。 and uh，, Start Time: 467960
Text:  so let's say， george， i'm martin。 i don't know two pages three， you know how the room is set up。 what is there？ how is the light who is comincrease living where they are sitting？, Start Time: 479280
Text:  yeah， and you you see one one perfectly。 let's seen。 if you comes he wks。 it's it's smiles。 so little little bit of viciousness，, Start Time: 487500
Text:  it's five seconds and you totally know what he wants what he thinks。 and this ah this is very universal all around the world will understand it。, Start Time: 496560
Text:  yeah， yeah， and it's very what we are trying to achieve。 uh in our games。 okay， it's little thinks this is this is despite this is the icing on the cake。, Start Time: 505220
Text:  that's what tell you that。 that's what tells you that it's true that this art。 this is they megaalthough， though they just just in the me，, Start Time: 515670
Text:  they're real for you。 they're emotion。 yeah， they mean what they're saying or what they're doing this yeah。 and if you have the same character that's not moving。, Start Time: 522710
Text:  and it's ah it's standing like a you know like a plastic doll。 you're you're like no them not not dlll stupid。 um then now you if you like，, Start Time: 531330
Text:  hey， you know， i don't believe it。 it's true。 so i think that， that's a very interesting direction with what i would like， uh， games to go cool，, Start Time: 543130
Text:  cool。 so about these characters， including syrian and uh and entries， have you？ uh， have you got any like momodes like you mentioned，, Start Time: 553080
Text:  you know， have you ever refer to any models to to build up their the official features？ i mean 啊， of course。 and so 嗯哼 i think we could probably write a couple of books about it，, Start Time: 562860
Text:  but from which i want， i think uh uh， we we always believe that art。 it's it's an incredibly important part of the storytelling，, Start Time: 574950
Text:  and that's what how we are using it。 so yes， we are using it。 we live models。 yeah， they are。 are guys are yeah。 the the this guys are experts in anatomy。, Start Time: 584930
Text:  yeah。 it's a very monding process because obvious you know， for the for the key chartors we put for the for the foguer attention tion。, Start Time: 594930
Text:  but ah it is important that the crowd is uh they're ve， and they have all the gestures。 yes。 so uh， what you see are this is actually very slavic。, Start Time: 603570
Text:  yeah， yeah slavic people。 there are scans of of some people from from team， but but but generally， we are looking quite often for those strange chartors。, Start Time: 613310
Text:  okay。 okay。 no wonder you say that because the most most keanfigures are are attractive， because the polish goes are attracted and beautiful。, Start Time: 621950
Text:  yeah， what it's just it。 it just just make things a bit easier。 yeah， yeah。 yeah， okay。 and also uh， we are now this this time，, Start Time: 632290
Text:  we notice that uh horses have appeaing a lot of a different video games and before， which are three the most impressive games， which make really hiled。, Start Time: 643180
Text:  and so you have the dmovement of horses is the， you know， the red dead redemption by rock star。 and they have uh going to uh going to the reports i've read，, Start Time: 652520
Text:  they have spent a ite ite a lot of strengthing in a research， you know， the how the horses moves， how they move， how the masses，, Start Time: 663700
Text:  you know in tense and how they， how the such things。 and so have have have builuh and and have quite like the movement of roach is roach。, Start Time: 673640
Text:  so have you have you also download of research by that in horses you？ ah yeah， i mean the have doing a lot of research。 and uh uh，, Start Time: 684540
Text:  horuum， we're looking after a moke coupon。 and when ultimately， we uh we decided to buy uh the moke up the animation and uh and and it look perfect。, Start Time: 694120
Text:  but then you know， then the animation is wanting yeah。 then the physics， how you animates the horse， how it moves in different environment。, Start Time: 707690
Text:  um and actually， this was uh this was AA very challengenging part of the whole gaming experience because uh few few a few months before the release。, Start Time: 715830
Text:  the rouach was still kind of not so nice to huandle。 and but but i can honstly say， i think that， that read that uh uh， was was was a was a role model for us by far。, Start Time: 728240
Text:  and we're looking at what they did and and can have ying to to， you know， you know， make it even better into which sion。 yeah ah ah it it is a tough one，, Start Time: 741180
Text:  because you know， okay， comes it。 it runs into a tit stops， then you know it's not going smsmoothly how you control it， how you control it and fight oah。, Start Time: 751620
Text:  ah this is really really tough gaming mechanics and you an open world。 i mean， come on， you have any less number of possibilities where you can have a problem。, Start Time: 760980
Text:  yeah。 i mean， like a gaming problem。 and then again， any kind of a problem like that， it's uh it's it's breaking the emotion。 and that's last thing rodel uah，, Start Time: 768120
Text:  i say， okay。 and now we 're was h， actually uh you a lot of users of our website。 we have released a video about the the sadmaster you have invited，, Start Time: 777460
Text:  which you capture his motions in in in action designs。 uh i really impressive where you really impressed by by by sirls。 and so it's like i've heard that you actually you have cooperate since the first the wish gagame ah ah really impressiso uthere any any interesting stories，, Start Time: 788810
Text:  you know， having between your studio。 and this uh this master， uh uh， you can share share with us。 i mean， there are there are professional standard。, Start Time: 808530
Text:  so um there are there are toutough guys。 and even when they shop and at our office and working uum， you can see that uh um HH are tain very tough onuuh。, Start Time: 818840
Text:  they are quite well build up， and they they do very physical work。 and and that's in a very tough and environment， yeah。 and for the which um from which the one until which are three，, Start Time: 832140
Text:  they are pretty much expanding the style。 so we they are actually joining with normal souort fighting with uh certain martial lots。, Start Time: 845060
Text:  and they the same time creating uuh h specifis and thing kind of unique style of the which icand acthink ding to fibooks yeah and h uureally their acthings to that。, Start Time: 853640
Text:  so um i think we've really achieved ed lot uum。 thanks to their support uum and whentever。 we actually are organizing um h think are and thetheyalways always part of，, Start Time: 864120
Text:  and they perform the stan's life。 and you can see how it look。 uh these guys are really real， you know， when they have no thousorts。, Start Time: 877830
Text:  yeah， what very this is supertiring， because in the which you know know you kill a monster after monof ter monster， because they they do three scenes。, Start Time: 886110
Text:  they're just sweating that the the water。 it's sweatand， it's uexaming uh h to speak。 so so it's a very， very uh laborates。 so and it's so very，, Start Time: 897770
Text:  very what we take consideration always is that um the fight is real。 so uh， the five takes into consideration the weight of the sts ds。, Start Time: 909470
Text:  ah nothing is really artificial in the game。 uh we are trying to make it uh， ureasononably realistic。 yeah， where would it if it it adds to the story，, Start Time: 918990
Text:  because you know， it cannot be too realistic as well， because girl would be tired after killing three。 it adds to the sunday。 yeah，, Start Time: 929730
Text:  but but it we in a sentence few。 we are trying to to give the realism because it as authenticity。 okay。 so can i understand？ so the the actions or the sort fightings in which are three are like，, Start Time: 936530
Text:  you know， a combination of different schools， or you know， these， you know， sort fighting in europe？ yes， yes， very much。 yes， okay，, Start Time: 951340
Text:  okay。 ah h co't been in in oof gts。 uh， we have umost a lot of games all around world have found milliings of easter eggs and in in which are three in um so far。, Start Time: 960200
Text:  uh cocoof most of the， you know the news you have read。 are there any most any like east ast gts that have haven't been found found by by gme us？, Start Time: 975140
Text:  um okay， easter eggs wouldn't be easter eggs if 'd be talking about them。 uh， sorry， that must be fun。 uh， i am saying that easter x wouldn't be easter x if you would tell you hey，, Start Time: 986075
Text:  and why is heep to know in skelego on this little lient？ no， no guys， i mean， look for them yourself。 that's part of the fun well。, Start Time: 999250
Text:  but it's just the question of， yes or no now II。 so some east acts in there that haven't been found yet。 now you can i can develop ers，, Start Time: 1008300
Text:  but body won't tell me。 okay， that's used to and XI say， okay。 now we have uh finshed most uh all the questions about the witchher，, Start Time: 1018180
Text:  but but we all know that you're next next next， your next work will be cyberpunk um h and twenty seventy six， seven。 and and and so we have also uh in the first seventies about that。, Start Time: 1028820
Text:  okay， there's not much。 there's not much i can talk about， and there's a the thbbunk k。 yes， ah think it's is。 it's way to there's there's one more ence of，, Start Time: 1042500
Text:  oh， yeah， there still have three big exa coming for the richer three， then forget about it。 then we still have two big expsions。, Start Time: 1051020
Text:  yes， which， as we said， there will be almost the size of which too。 so yeah， still is not much of of the team。 and the which of team is working on that。, Start Time: 1057360
Text:  yeah， one is coming in october。 the hearts of stone and the second one is coming in uh in the first quarof next year。 so there's still still part lot of of experience。, Start Time: 1065660
Text:  but yeah， ah part of the team move on cyberpunk and uh uh what they are on， but it's it's too earearly to tell anything besides the general stustuff。, Start Time: 1075600
Text:  we we we talk about before ah and and we really don't want to take the attention of gamers ers away from which h there is still yeah，, Start Time: 1087510
Text:  when there still still quite time time uh h uh， for cyberpunk to come。 so you know when cyer we'll just well just undel ah HHH，, Start Time: 1098390
Text:  we just make a big pution。 we say， hey， this is what it is。 this is how it looks like。 and let's expected on this in that date。, Start Time: 1109050
Text:  i think that's the only fair way to go really cool， cool。 okay。 so uh， but you you have mentioned， which are three。 and so yeah，, Start Time: 1115550
Text:  we have had siri got this power， which he， she can doutiars。 you know， the the vel of the world， and she can travels， you know，, Start Time: 1125870
Text:  between different different the ds。 and and the some some players have mentioned that actually， he， he， he doubts that one of the one of the very siyfii world siri has mentioned to garout。, Start Time: 1135430
Text:  it is， is， is is the world of cyber upong twenty seventy seven and does so。 so。 so this sts a good on， i like it。 okay。 so this this guy's question is，, Start Time: 1149449
Text:  well， we see siri inside a punk twenty seventy seven， yeah。 and will there be more cross over s between these two， two， two， two games？, Start Time: 1163585
Text:  serious？ uh， we know we know that the gamers have wild imagination， but this has exceed mind。 so no HH this he's speaking no ah h ah HH be speking cards ds ah ah h that a great great cards ah ah ah h sisyriand，, Start Time: 1173170
Text:  the sort of KK out there will be there。 there will be riking cards。 yeah。 alright。 okay。 um so we also have some some more questions about studens itself，, Start Time: 1204760
Text:  the city project。 so have have you got any any plans to have some overseas sectors like？ and also， are you know we don't you don't you don't you don't okay。, Start Time: 1216640
Text:  so so we don't we don't。 and and the answer is that we wlighten and we lauugh and and big part of my work。 it's it's it's it's growing our international business，, Start Time: 1228980
Text:  and i'm traveling a lot so very， very much part of my olife。 but ah i i'm a strong advocate of of uh， you know， really like a controlled and extremely well communicate development process。, Start Time: 1241340
Text:  and then if we would ever have something like this， this would have to be separate， stupid， working with toably different project，, Start Time: 1258140
Text:  because uh or otherwise， it ouldn't be the which are are all the side upon is it would have to be something else。 um the i think we we can make games of such scales with such ambition just because we have noned of full control on the project and going to make create decisions very，, Start Time: 1265100
Text:  very fast and and see what they turn into and it。 and the you know uh， like a very sort of the the distute， because studistructure has it's prose because it can do more yeah theoretically，, Start Time: 1286610
Text:  but the quality it's always always inmistiand。 it's always a tough one。 yeah。 yeah。 agree。 yeah。 so you've got ah you'got got your own。, Start Time: 1301190
Text:  um well， well， OG me platform g ugh。 so um uh so so also people all compell GOG was steam and uh for four chinese video game players and steam is important and crucial because it's it's really it's open to to the chinese game market。, Start Time: 1310070
Text:  and it's really uh， it's it's logalization is it's really great。 and so well GOG considered。 so you know， to be open to the chinese market，, Start Time: 1327190
Text:  just like steam in the future。 yeah， we 're definitely we definitely would laughter。 so um ah ah we we are still developing。 we are still growing。, Start Time: 1336950
Text:  yeah right now。 we have uh for actually last year and and this year， we found ded several future versions。 and uh HH of these speaking chinese is very high and at least so um HH ve ve out uh french，, Start Time: 1345630
Text:  german and russian on top of english。 and you know， uh ah， i think think we will be moving forward with uh with subsequent ment gugues。, Start Time: 1361040
Text:  we definitely will consider chinese。 okay， cool。 thank you。 and so we also have a lot of talented。 uh chinese um h these programmers and get game developers。, Start Time: 1368660
Text:  they have really interested to to participate in CD project， you know， and and and and and so they are very curious you， you， uh，, Start Time: 1379640
Text:  what kind of very andanders have you got for for these developers？ you know， h these programmers who want to join you？ yeah， i think here are just yeah，, Start Time: 1389980
Text:  just just h uh， II can tell you how our studio has changed in the the witter one。 uh we had maybe one teen member out of ninety or eighty，, Start Time: 1399860
Text:  who's who wasn't polish right now。 ah the whole group is four hundred fifty fifty people。 it's all basing it also with that with a small with a small office in carcoo as well。, Start Time: 1410460
Text:  and uh outsay probably thirty percent of the stuff。 it's foreign um maybe even maybe going closer er forty ah h be probably right now ah the the language within the company is english，, Start Time: 1421000
Text:  everything is done in english。 and actually whaever amamwork looking for most stush english， uh because it's probably english。 so h ah if that's interested，, Start Time: 1436180
Text:  so h is our career english ah h that's probably site。 so so and it's definitely looking for for talent from all around the world，, Start Time: 1445100
Text:  regardless where you're from uah as because you're fine with english。 and you know， we we rut off to talk to you。 and uh， the top of that，, Start Time: 1453980
Text:  we you must be talve with games and prefer the the talp g games because that's be even probably looking of the discuswe're looking for the best best as because where 're world，, Start Time: 1463860
Text:  we i'm guarant。 it's a great environment， then you know， making the best games in the world。 that's our cg s。 okay， cool。 and also i'm already cares about that。, Start Time: 1472760
Text:  so so ar have have you already emploloed any chinese programmers？ it's good presst。 but as as as as far as and as far as i know，, Start Time: 1482490
Text:  yeah， this is to my best knowledge。 i might be wrong because there our recruitment process is going on all the time， but it's just be as i know。, Start Time: 1493100
Text:  no， no， we don't ah we don't have that upon okay， cool。 okay， so well h ah it's not l not cooool。 so so so not cool， othink ay。, Start Time: 1499820
Text:  yeah， i say i say， i ah have to have some guys。 so so have no fear ah， just just give it a and and by the way， we help with let relocation，, Start Time: 1511300
Text:  no， no， the issue for anyone ah relocated people from all around the world， but ah in the in the game development from more diicsee in the western sphere。, Start Time: 1519860
Text:  ar， it's most do know no westerway。 we moving around europe or for u。 and and is sort of mixing all the time and maybe be eastern europebut，, Start Time: 1529360
Text:  but don't even have that many people from modereastern european countries。 it's most the western european US。 okay， i say， and ah oh ah seethink that you really you have really a high high tolerance towards the privacy，, Start Time: 1536580
Text:  a privacy version of your own on which a franchse。 and and so um and also， we understand uh and ononce was， but um you know， a member of the socialist family yeso。, Start Time: 1552570
Text:  you have also mentioned that before uh， you know， several decades ago， people really， you know， the polish market is bit like uh chinese market during the the unities ties ah a lot of privacy，, Start Time: 1566690
Text:  yeah ververo games of primovies。 so now uh， now how how w's 's a polish sh h market， you know how how popolish but ms of， but in terms of privacy，, Start Time: 1580970
Text:  yeah yeah。 i mean， it's like i think africa has in the world。 the piracy moves to internet here。 yeah， ah we used to have all these free markets and you know，, Start Time: 1594350
Text:  um people selling cities right now。 we just go to torerinwhere anywhere。 you don't load it， but but what i think we uh um we we to detroate manage to um um manage to help with uh in terms of of of the change of making the change was to convince people convince game is imppoland。, Start Time: 1604990
Text:  and then in central europe， yeah， centrally same europe that buying a game make sense。 yeah， is the same attitude we have with the which ch or GOG for GG is the it's is is the core part of the of the business correct ah ah ah h woullin，, Start Time: 1626969
Text:  the rethree， because because hover ver wouldn't protect a game， it will be correct。 yeah。 and the the proacin nineteen nine percent of cases happens on the day dozn't before。, Start Time: 1644810
Text:  so the protection doesn't work because that's the reality。 yeah ah the um if protection doesn't work uh it， it means people can can verate your game at any time。, Start Time: 1655390
Text:  so the only way you can convince them。 it's not with saying though you you， but if you pooate to the game， but saying them， hey，, Start Time: 1669370
Text:  if you would buy the legal game， you'll get a lot of goodies you have support。 you have pches， you get get goods es， you'll be part of the great game。, Start Time: 1677270
Text:  and you'll be talking about your friends， how much you love the game and how much you want a grent。 and besides， we make great gae。, Start Time: 1685610
Text:  yeah。 so so this is you know， i'm always saying yeah。 this is um desiserour values， but this is also very conscious business model。, Start Time: 1691550
Text:  yeah， we ah we are not not charity ity cancannot， say y guys ys and popower our game me。 yeah， oh， no， no， no。 if i will say things like that and all paradot games in mass will go out of business，, Start Time: 1701410

Text:  right？ they have。 that's that's really cool game。 have you ever played that game？ yeah， finished it。 you finfinish it。 and we have yeah，, Start Time: 2192670
Text:  and we have notied that in in the the new， which are three。 we have like this。 uh， these option these option system that you you，, Start Time: 2201030
Text:  you can only choose h， you can can can chose se。 the was you like to say， with very limited time， right？ yeah。 and and so is that is that inspired by by the total games，, Start Time: 2209440
Text:  i think it was uh it's uh i don't think it's tae tatata's invention。 it was already in uh previous game。 i'm the truth。 it was bih。, Start Time: 2222890
Text:  yeah， but definitely， you know um whenever there is someone that's that's doing good storytelling。 and and there's not that many companies in the gaming world doing that。, Start Time: 2231530
Text:  uh personally that's think thetheir stuff。 and if we see something inspiring um， we we try to make it better。 so ah uh in this case，, Start Time: 2240390
Text:  i'm the trth， it was。 uh， yeah， it was their inspiration。 i think i've seen it elsewhere。 but uh， i think by way， it was， you think it uah，, Start Time: 2249649
Text:  yeah， but definitely， we we are looking looking and and watching。 and and i'm personally a huge fan of of tail tail。 yeah， yeah，, Start Time: 2256710
Text:  the wolf from ongs actually。 finally enough， i first we play the game and only done i reach to the coming books， uh acwas the fabit。, Start Time: 2264430
Text:  but actually， i didn't like too much。 and for me， it's it's it's it's it's a bit to crazy。 i like the much more than i than i like the comcoming book。, Start Time: 2273890
Text:  yeah， but working debt。 yeah， that's a great great ststyteluh ah， really， because really think they they deserve all the erle awards。, Start Time: 2284280
Text:  the sales into preplace II have such a good time with this thing。 yeah， yeah。 and uh well， it's just a personal suggestions about，, Start Time: 2294280
Text:  you know， to choosing the option with a limit of that。 uh when i'm playing tel tol games， this really a paying for me time。 ah ah most of that texi english，, Start Time: 2302520
Text:  there's no chinese version sion over that because that's have like lochoptions， so have have chochose se no reasing like ten seconds。, Start Time: 2311180
Text:  but before you know， the time ended， III can't even finish reading， probably like i only have finish reading two lines of that。, Start Time: 2318340
Text:  and and that's so i don't have enough time and also about that。 uh because that's have have have introdued。 so there's mechanisms to to the which of that。, Start Time: 2326320
Text:  and uh and II deably， probably， you know， the different languages， you know， even the same uh amount of information over that， you know，, Start Time: 2336635
Text:  probably， for example， englilish， it takes， you know， probably five seconds to finish to read both lines and about probably japanese，, Start Time: 2347930
Text:  it will take you like six seconds or seven seconds。 so in the future。 and do think， you know， probably， you can consider， you know，, Start Time: 2356710
Text:  the， you know， the characacuh h， no different languages， you know， you know， the lengs， which you know you h， in average， you know how long it will take to finish that line，, Start Time: 2365870
Text:  you know， then to design a different times you， you know， it takes h， know， know you h， you give to the players。 we definitely can actually could you could you send me a particular example of such a scene which chinese give it，, Start Time: 2376350
Text:  if it to do？ it's a very， it's a very， very valuable comment。 yeh， i think you know， people should feel comfortable with with reading the language and especially yeah，, Start Time: 2394000
Text:  if you are reading traditional chinese。 yes， yes， it can be。 it's chchallenge most。 uh it's not really challenging， but it's just you know more slightly more time consumer。, Start Time: 2405130
Text:  it might take us more than like two seconds more to finish each line to seconds probably， but just it's a mainit， it's it's a certain slower than it ououldn't like that。, Start Time: 2414790
Text:  um yeah。 so if yes， like so most of mainand chinese plaplayers， they can comprehend traditratraditional ineinewithwithout didificfict ties，, Start Time: 2425510
Text:  but just just just inly， but but is a slightly slower slightly slowwer。 yeah。 so if we can in the future， that will be a simplified chinese one，, Start Time: 2435030
Text:  it'll be really appreciate it。 yes。 yeah。 yeah。 next time i meet dell tell because ah i've seen the amount ago we've signed the games for jujue did go。, Start Time: 2444515
Text:  come。 yeah， II will mention them that。 uh they definitely should have a uh chinese version。 thank you so much。 thank you so much。, Start Time: 2455530
Text:  they， they also they have lots of fans in china as well。 okay。 so so besides uh， the the the walking that we you have mentioned uuh，, Start Time: 2463920

Text:  in different ways。 yeah， i mean， if if if look look at this this um uis， uh， there was two hundred uh fifty um and above that finishing the which of so ah ah and when we started those probably hundred，, Start Time: 2534350
Text:  yes， each of them is a walking of talking games and psychopdia， and they play everything uah。 so if you put it all together， uh，, Start Time: 2552229
Text:  you will have a superlongest of who was inspired。 so what ah ah so i we play， we religily play all the the p ges。 um we look at the story telling。, Start Time: 2561750

Text:  yes。 ah in terms of of the characters and uh and the perfect realization um in a smaller and more complex more is the last last us。, Start Time: 2583430
Text:  yes， yes。 ah i think you ah then then we look at at the twist in the story i ving into walking that。 and ah each of us has a certain favorite game。, Start Time: 2592810
Text:  you know， some people prefare to to spend their time with with abbulow and some people um prefer to to repeatively die dararkso。, Start Time: 2603180
Text:  so all these games， our inspiration， but i think that's that's the beauty of game development。 um then you know， if if you look at the which ure，, Start Time: 2612460
Text:  so these are the inspirations from the gaming world is。 but uh as a studio uh， we are regularly going to the movies， and the studies inviting the healting to the moviner to see the most recent is h the movies。, Start Time: 2622280
Text:  yeah， all the mathemax is all the super hero， everything。 so you know， a lot of inspiration。 sometimes um i think even other， but if youare are mentioning to me so much，, Start Time: 2635920
