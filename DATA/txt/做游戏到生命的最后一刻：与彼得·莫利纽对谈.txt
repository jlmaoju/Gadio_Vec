Text:  pay。 uh， thank you so much for the time my name is kurt， and i'm with g course here。 uh and g course is a domestic game or community and a game media here。, Start Time: 3900
Text:  and we celebrate uh everything about games。 so it's a great honor for us to talk you。 um so it's great honher me to talk。 i can show you it's a shame because if you're in beijing，, Start Time: 14460
Text:  it would have been so easy presus to meet up。 yeah， yeah， yeah， but i'm beme ing time。 so um i'm over in beijing in march next time。, Start Time: 27500
Text:  so um maybe we should meet up， then that would be it would be great。 well， um i can't say that the majority of people here knows your name，, Start Time: 38680
Text:  so but i bet every boy in my generation knows at least one of your games， a really yes， at least one or two of your games。 and for me，, Start Time: 49460
Text:  personally， that would be a theme hospital。 yeah， yeah， it's such a such a fun game such a great game。 i used to play it all day long。, Start Time: 61750
Text:  and yeah， it's it's fun with a sort of a dark humor in it。 yes。 and and the interesting thing it。 so i never got really good it。, Start Time: 70750
Text:  it。 i don't think i master the game eventually， so II always enjoy。 you know， the struggling managing that hospital and just meeting with the strange uh patients and yeah，, Start Time: 81570
Text:  stranger uh， the employees。 so just it's just just amazing，再见。 well， thank you for for that。 it was the theme。 hospital was a great was a fun game to do because it was。, Start Time: 95790
Text:  but bad thing it was， it was kind of one of the first simulation games where um he simulated something real， but put a lot of humor into it。, Start Time: 109830
Text:  so yeah， did a game called thin park。 and then we said， well， we enjoy doing their game so much。 let's do the hospital。 yeah。 and i was i got the idea because i was in hospital ones with this strange allergy that i that i got。, Start Time: 122220
Text:  and i thought what i was in hospital， you know， in the excient emergency， i thought it's so crazy here。 you know， there's so many people rushing around。, Start Time: 143370
Text:  and so many， you know， new patients coming in。 and with all these bizarre conditions， wouldn't be a great idea for a game。 so it was yeah。, Start Time: 152530
Text:  it was based on um there was one disease in the in the in the in theme hospital called btchy， blow up disease。 and that was big had that that a huge head thing，, Start Time: 161090
Text:  right？ yeah， i thought i ve my face ewell up because i was bitten my spider and moore， my face well up。 and so i went into that was that was a real thing that happened to me。, Start Time: 175800
Text:  yes， OK。 wow， that's that's one hello story。 okay。 so um yeah。 so just II just want anststart this uh talk with a sort of a big question，, Start Time: 189320
Text:  like in your long history of the game designing like we we don't usually get the chance to talk to such a veteran right in this industry like you。, Start Time: 204030
Text:  so in your long history in this industry， so do you find it like vastly changed or essentially stayed the same of his core in the creativity side of game making，, Start Time: 217060
Text:  and it is change a hell a lot。 and i think every every creative industry， you know， every like beauty， gaames or film more tv read。, Start Time: 229260
Text:  if it body's technology， it has to accept that is gonna。 you know， it's the the vast change change that has come about in harby terms is is obvious，, Start Time: 242000
Text:  just like his fililman and tv。 they huge changes in technology。 they had uh at its all the the idea that we are entertaining people and relowing them to escape their lives。, Start Time: 259200
Text:  it is ruwing the same。 and um you know， there's been incredible differences in a way that people get our games in the way that they uh can update the games。, Start Time: 274560
Text:  you could remember that games back in the， you know， back in the ninety and and and two thousands used to make a game release a game，, Start Time: 286620
Text:  and that was it。 you've finished with the game completely。 you do。 they move on to the next development。 yeah。 but now because of that，, Start Time: 296000
Text:  it's it's a continual process that you go through yeah， the way the way that we um the people learn about our game。 you know， games being made is completely different。, Start Time: 303680
Text:  now。 it's totally different。 so there's lots of changes around what games are。 so you know how people buy them， how they how they consume them，, Start Time: 315700
Text:  how long they play for for them。 but at the core， i think it's the same and the core， i think， is allowing people to feel like their immerin the world and to feel like their important and such a unique，, Start Time: 326960
Text:  a form of entertament ment。 think think you to gaames。 i think i think there's nothing nothing close to it。 i can think of that is like game，, Start Time: 344395
Text:  because we you know the they real， the real aspiration of every game is to make you feel good about the challenges that you'faced whether ther it been thing hospital or whether it be in whether duduor whether ther it be，, Start Time: 355550
Text:  you know what just mean of what gatting you're talking about？ or that is always true that the player must feel good about what they're doing。, Start Time: 373190
Text:  yeah， the real aspedence。 yeah， well， maybe not as important as a god， but essentially they feel good and important。 okay， feel good and important。, Start Time: 380690
Text:  and they they， you know， my personally， i love to make people love， and i love to make them。 remember， yeah， do you remember that lotche flow up？, Start Time: 393050
Text:  yeah hospital and that， that， that makes me so happy because no it。 it's there's so many years that i passed， and she played gagame。, Start Time: 405660
Text:  you used to remember more lcrual credible feeling that is， yeah， yeah。 thank you so much for for that game and everything。 so um let's just jump right into the good，, Start Time: 416480
Text:  good old days， like i was born in nineteen eighty six。 so so II don't i know nothing about game industry。 what was it was uh in the eighties or in the early ninety。, Start Time: 428340
Text:  so i was it like um back then， and i it has you get get into it。 yeah， it was almost knowing existence back。 and yeah， i an if you took all the developers in the world，, Start Time: 442820
Text:  they could fit into one um one big conference room。 yeah， i think about they used to have a。 they still have the game developers conference。, Start Time: 458300
Text:  and the early ones i went to there。 there were four hundred uh four hundred developers that we used to go along。 and i think the last game developers conference，, Start Time: 470340
Text:  there is forty thousand developers a monyeah。 so no， no， no one even thought it was an industry back。 then it was just a it was a hobby。, Start Time: 483210
Text:  and you know uh， i can remember um you know， talking to people and and saying you ah， i make computer games and and people would say what a ridiculous use of your time。, Start Time: 494630
Text:  that is， you know， it's going a it's a fat。 it's going to go away。 and for me， back in the early days， it was a real accident that that got me into the gaames industry in that there was a company back then who made um home computers um and and it was called a comment ommega。, Start Time: 508190
Text:  and it was there was a tory。 there was a mega and those， and there was the spectrum， and those were the main computers， and they mistakenly sent me six machine of their development machines。, Start Time: 532375
Text:  it was a pure mistake。 okay。 thanks to me， because they， my company was called tourius， and it it used to import。 ant export is a tiny little companies。, Start Time: 549480
Text:  the important export 呃 products tune from the uh all know know so of the place， but noknow te to from the middle lisk。 and he thought we were another company called tourist，, Start Time: 561350
Text:  yeah to go AUS。 and so they sent these free development machines。 and i thought， well， you know， got these development machines，, Start Time: 577520
Text:  i mind as well。 i mind as well write a game for it。 and i wrote this game called popular well that the degregreat game was based on the libasay。, Start Time: 586680
Text:  basically， yeah， because was it was based was completely based on light。 it was based on two things。 it was based on lie， and it was also based upon a core game。, Start Time: 597300
Text:  mechanic was based upon， you know， was only me doing the cogiing at the game。 so and i couldn't work out how to move the little characters around。, Start Time: 607950
Text:  so i thought i'll just get the player to change the land to play a chanveland。 so it was a complete accident。 oh， my god， i how that came about。, Start Time: 618520
Text:  and you know， it was just me and a friend sitting in a time in little room， making this game。 and then suddenly it came the game came out okand。, Start Time: 629620
Text:  it's ununbelievably successful。 you know， it was just your way more successful than you。 we possibly imagine it with in the year of its launch。, Start Time: 641860
Text:  it accounted for a third of all that electroniccar's revenue。 so it was it was just it。 it was an incredible time well。 and so you know，, Start Time: 653540
Text:  but it it was it was only there was no other developers in gilft at that time。 and so you know， we we we just we we were just making up everything that we did yeah by accident thought，, Start Time: 664910
Text:  very， very rect。 and and you've got to remember back then。 there's one very important fact。 there was no internet。 there was no，, Start Time: 680140
Text:  you know， there was no instet。 there was no books， you could there you couldn't buy bbook， you know how how make games， or you know everything thing you did did had to invvent。, Start Time: 689780
Text:  ah first， every single thing that you did， you have to invent。 and so it was it was falln out of out of accon trade。 yeah。 so was it honor like a floppy disk or or a portrage？, Start Time: 700540
Text:  or i don't know the first motions came out on um three ina halalf inch ch k yeah， you can half。 yeah。 yeah， yeah， about this shape，, Start Time: 717110
Text:  okay， and you you put it in。 and i've still got the original， the original dissks that it there was probably corrupts now。 but i've so got the original disks。, Start Time: 727090
Text:  ks， wow is ttand。 and you know， that was very scary because these disto was used to go wrong。 so you do used to after uh， is it change possible？, Start Time: 736870
Text:  man？要不嗯哼 you are when you are developing， you can constantly have to change dissks over time。 yeah， have dissccan if you got a discigrt over written。, Start Time: 751570
Text: 有有，他说了个能不是办卡，又能有他打。 yeah， so it it's very， very franky。 so no steam， no digital distribution at at all。 so no digital distribution，, Start Time: 761335
Text:  no， no， um 要不是 there was the hardest were just coming in。 and hardests are new。 yeah， the hardest were very， very new。 and my first，, Start Time: 774750
Text:  my first hard days that i got for my for my mega was an amazing five mega bytes。 and i thought， it's no way i've ever going to feel five meggabbghtes。, Start Time: 788815
Text:  well， now， you know， you can't even think of storing anything in five megabbytes。 so yeah wewaste allther than a memory。 it's h it's is is is is the no mistakes。, Start Time: 804100
Text:  it's it's it's about a thousand thousand about about a thousands of a normal as a mber mistake here。 wow。 that's that's really，, Start Time: 817520
Text:  really incredible。 i mean， we uh here with with my friends， we we always talk about this。 it's like miracles， like like what you just described，, Start Time: 827030
Text:  like they kind kind rararely happen。 and i mean， it's just more more difficult for anyone or any small group to make a miracle like that today。, Start Time: 838230
Text:  i mean， everything is made like for a certain group of people， and it just falls right into into a ononger。 and they do the same thing again and just polishing it and improve it slightly better。, Start Time: 850490
Text:  and and it seems that the majority of and the game developers， they give one or really coming up with original idea today。 that's what what frustrrame a bit。, Start Time: 866450
Text:  yeah。 the problem here is that there's lots of problems coming together that， that makes original enmuch more difficult today and know the the biggest problem is funding because because if you go to a publisher and you say，, Start Time: 879910
Text:  you know， i'm going to make something totally new it。 and they have， and you know， they， if they have three people pitching to them，, Start Time: 900760
Text:  one person saying， i'm to make something quick new。 one person saying， i'm well， i'm going going to make something， you know， like them，, Start Time: 910820
Text:  like， like a clasasc game。 and one person saying， i'm going to i'm going to make the exact coffee of the game。 that's number one in the charts。, Start Time: 919340
Text:  then publishers， you know， they're going to a make money。 yeah。 so they take the one that's you know the one。 that's that's going to be like the one at the top，, Start Time: 929865
Text:  the child。 so so and that's say the same for me enough， you noted the original populus。 uh， it took a long time to sway the publisher to，, Start Time: 938900
Text:  to i published the game。 yeah， on the， i can't the was。 yeah， i can't imagine that they they would find it hard to describe for just what it is。, Start Time: 950930
Text:  yeah， because they don't know how to describe it because there's no presidents for for it。 so that seea very， very difficult say。, Start Time: 963740
Text:  but then on the other side， you know there is and there's been very good examples of this。 there is so many ways for developers to communicate to the uh to to the gaming community 啊 directly。, Start Time: 972120
Text: 所以你的 making um making little prototypes and releasing them and showing off your work as you develop it。 yeah， something that you couldn't do that。, Start Time: 990855
Text:  then yeah ah h so i think original games definitely are going to continue to come。 okay。 so games， and i've seen this have that at that time when it is easy to develop and release and for consumers to accept an original game。, Start Time: 1003170
Text:  yeah， it's in a cycle and that about very true of have lots of original game suddenly come out。 yeah， people start trying。 so ah then it goes away。, Start Time: 1027020
Text:  and then seven years later， you lolots of original gaames come out and that this is very true of in the music industry。 it's very true in in TV。, Start Time: 1039340
Text:  yeah， the musiinfilm is that you know， there is at the moment in film theynot， not so orioriininal films， it's in a real。 and it's you know every every in the west，, Start Time: 1049440
Text:  every sumthat。 those know every superhero movie， every christmas there is a christmas movie off fronchyes。 but but tv v if tlook on tv，, Start Time: 1063240
Text:  there's so much innovation gono yeah gollden ager tv。 and i'm i truly believe that where if a few original games came out， then uh，, Start Time: 1074370
Text:  there would be a gold nate of original gaames as well。 well， we short look forward to it， but yes， but it's obviously not now。 i mean，, Start Time: 1087830
Text:  big games just like bandman and marvel stuff。 you yes， it is very， very similar， but you know， consumers will get bored。 that's what it everything is led by games。, Start Time: 1096985
Text:  yeah。 who would the games？ and as soon as and and i ve noticed recently that you know， game is are starting to get very a little bit bored at the same thing。, Start Time: 1112460
Text:  i'm in as amazing games coming out some incredible graphics， but people really want a new relationship with the game。 and this is what i think i think of，, Start Time: 1126110
Text:  yes， graphics are very， very important。 sounds are very， very important。 and the acceptbility of the game incredibly important。, Start Time: 1139160
Text:  yeah， but it's your relationship with the game。 that's so important。 that is so essential is what i feel i am inside the game and how i feel i can be myself inside a game。, Start Time: 1147940
Text:  and how that connects to other people is where the unique is， will comin， especially what ams down to connecting to other people。, Start Time: 1163480
Text:  because in you know， if you were， if you the first thing that we said is the unique thing about games is how i get a sense of satisfaction of what what i do in again。, Start Time: 1172720
Text:  and and relationtionand that is so important。 well， well， so unique e， you connect to other people。 yeah， and for me， i think it's my relationship with the game and my relationship through that game with other people。, Start Time: 1185960
Text:  that is is going to bring about some very， very interesting game that it's simply don't exist them because that digital relationship that we have is still very，, Start Time: 1201240
Text:  very crude and still not， uh， not being explored。 so i think there's a very interesting interesting thing。 yeah。 okay。 so speaking of that ah，, Start Time: 1213530
Text:  i have this this question that um it's very related。 i mean， do you do you find gammers changing a lot during the past decades？, Start Time: 1225640
Text:  or i mean， like do they become more impatient？ or do they demand more or like more clear about what they want， more specific about what they want and just the gammers just just make gamers and consumers 哦，, Start Time: 1236480
Text:  have a they demand quality。 yes， they demand equality experience。 yes。 and the quality that we have to provide to satisfy that is in very，, Start Time: 1255080
Text:  very high。 you know， if you think of if you think of the average council gain uh in west， the production quality on not those games is incredibly high。, Start Time: 1270280
Text:  yeah。 um and if you think of if you just compare what a mobile game was just three years ago to what it is now the protection qualities getting incredibly ly hind，, Start Time: 1283925
Text:  yes。 and because of mobile， we have a vast， a vast number of of of of gamens， you know， hundreds of millions of games， playing games，, Start Time: 1296720
Text:  games， and they all demand this quality， and and it is our job。 and to make sure that they， they they get this quality。 but essentially，, Start Time: 1312840
Text:  although the new games ers are very， you know， the new mobile gamers are very different essentially at the core。 it's the same。, Start Time: 1325325
Text:  people aren't a sense of escape， and they want a sense of wonder。 they want to feel something yeah， they want to to feel the excitement of winning a battle。, Start Time: 1336200
Text:  they want to to feel the they wanna feel the the delight of solving a challenge。 they anna feel they can colcolaborate and joying forces together。, Start Time: 1350990
Text:  so in that way， the the order， the the trip was many， many， many times more。 um they really at the core。 it's the same。 and it the pace of that again，, Start Time: 1363610
Text:  is very important nowadays， how quickly someone can get into again， essense， you know， you have back in the early day。 thing hospital was the sign actually，, Start Time: 1378310
Text:  um you， you， you， you。 it was very painful to play the game at start that i let to learn all the couples you had to you had to，, Start Time: 1393465
Text:  you know， you had to play through these tutorials。 sometimes you had to read a manual。 yeah， what's now you have about ten seconds，, Start Time: 1405340
Text:  the tension？ yeah， before fothethethey going。 well， i wren't up up before the the this。 i mean， i'm going to move the next appple。, Start Time: 1415985
Text:  yeah， because i have too many options。 i mean， i don't have to play that disreally this kind of shit， if if you are tree， treating me bad like that。, Start Time: 1423910
Text:  so so so so what you have to do is you have to insteall essence of curiosity in the player almost immediately。 yes。 and that is very，, Start Time: 1431190
Text:  very， it's very tricky to do yethen then know other other side of it。 incredible thing is some people are some games are playing games，, Start Time: 1443570
Text:  especially especially online connected games。 they are playing games， not for a few days or for a few weeks。 they're playing against me years，, Start Time: 1453810
Text:  every single day theyy're playing again for years。 yes。 so you nowadays， you know back even i the ideas， the game called feeble on a faeball on m ah yeah yethink。, Start Time: 1464140
Text:  i think it took about three years pick this guy to make faapal took about three years， and it was about one hundred fifty people，, Start Time: 1478730
Text:  people in the game， and we work incredibly hard。 we work， you know， maybe sixty as a day for you all all for all that， how time and i can remember the game being released and released on a priety。, Start Time: 1489840
Text: 嗯， um and the next tuesday， i got this letter through the post。 it was recrecon the friday。 and then on the tuesday， other letter in the post，, Start Time: 1505365
Text:  when someone saying i finished your game and really， really enjoyed i cowboy this one。 and i thought， i've got got aspect all this time，, Start Time: 1515710
Text:  making this game just play a whole game in one weekend。 and yes， that is so different。 now when you release again， some people will at well absolutely need content and need challenges and engagement for many，, Start Time: 1524650
Text:  many， many months and any years of that。 so so gme ers have changed。 they changed in their demand for quality。 they they changed in their accessibility，, Start Time: 1545580
Text:  the game， how easy it is to understand how easy is to play。 and they've changed in in uh they're playing sessions and and playing time。, Start Time: 1557880
Text:  so that that has changed and that that has changed in other creative medium like television， if you are， is facilating experiment，, Start Time: 1569180
Text:  which she should do go back。 and watch of this ybe true in china。 i'm not sure， but it's certainly true in the west。 if you watch a tv program or a film from the eighens，, Start Time: 1578340
Text:  every camera shot， they have is so slow。 it's slow。 you know， and and the cameras， if someone is going somewhere， the camera will follow the person，, Start Time: 1593930
Text:  and they get in the car they'be a shorter than turning the car on， they'll be shoort ter， the car polywell。 we don't have any other that now。, Start Time: 1608180
Text:  and now we have on TPDM film。 we have four second cuts， yes， every four seconds。 there is a new cut back in the eighties。 it was ninety second cuts every ninety second，, Start Time: 1616740
Text:  and the same is true game。 we have。 we have so much more accessibility now than going back to the yeah， yeah wwow like， well， maybe it's just in。, Start Time: 1630540
Text:  i mean， and i always feel like that。 i'm myself is it's kind of a nerd and always maybe that's kind of anti intellectualism， like like the game developers are trying way too hard to impress people to ease people in their games and to make everything effortless and just easy to enjoy。, Start Time: 1642800
Text:  and maybe that would become uh uh constraint or obstacle for us to um to celebrate or to to even have more games in the eighties，, Start Time: 1666880
Text:  like the same hospital。 this easy， i access thing for me is i always hear that it would it could be too much to just too spoil people。, Start Time: 1680220
Text:  so what do you think about that？ it's a real design challenge really real deep design challenge in the today's generate to today's world。, Start Time: 1691645
Text:  you dealing with people in network that have so many choices and options。 yeah，哎， if you think about how even it was designing again，, Start Time: 1705075
Text:  but someone that you knew and walks to a shop uh and walked in and browse and picture your picture game of the shelf， walked back home，, Start Time: 1718550
Text:  install the game。 they put so much time。 yeah and said， yeah， they they will be much more willing to to to stick with the game。, Start Time: 1732540
Text:  you can pare that today， where on my mobile device， especially but on the PC definitely and on guone councils， you know， if i'm i'm bobored with this game，, Start Time: 1744970
Text:  i immediately i sswitch another another ah ah that leads in design terms， this to this very tricky problem solve。 yeah， anntrriicy problem is，, Start Time: 1756960
Text:  how can i care？ can i keep my players committed？ yes， how can i obtain my players and the but this there's an answer？ and it's very simple answer is i can ask a player to do an unbelieve with the challenging thing that may be a very boring thing，, Start Time: 1770855
Text:  maybe getting undergrgrand it maybe AA boss battle， which is incredily hard to fight， or it maybe II call chchallengit is very hard to defeat。, Start Time: 1794210
Text:  so long as the anticipation of winning that battle of of snichol battle is really， really strong rewarding。 so it's if i said you in the game，, Start Time: 1806690
Text:  there is an infinite number of of was say， fighting because it's easy to understand yeah， an infinite number of fights and just keep coming on and on and on。, Start Time: 1821560
Text: 对， then you may say all like that， sounds for you know， i ah ah that's okay for a first few times， but after after while while give give，, Start Time: 1830920
Text:  yeah， but advoice to you ook there is this bbattle。 at the other side， this this battle， there is a box。 and in this box， there is the most incredible，, Start Time: 1840530
Text:  amazing thing that is beginning to get your curiosity of thinking， eat the bus because i've got to get to the thing。 yeah。 and it's more important now，, Start Time: 1850790
Text:  but we always make sure that a plays motivation about what is next。 what is round the next corner？ what's over the next hill？ what what is comes after than this challenge，, Start Time: 1862320
Text:  whether it be a creigallof or big change ether to be exchelent ent？ yeah， keep people wonder， and curious。 yeah， then people will just give up。, Start Time: 1875980
Text:  so you have we have to it's more craft。 we need more craft。 and in the gains industry， and we need to realize ze that things like narrative and story and rewards and anticipation。, Start Time: 1886490
Text:  i to be very， very well， well prompted， yeah， very yeah。 okay。 thank you。 so so let's go back to weeto your your work。 let's let's talk about the god game like that's such a stronger defining game，, Start Time: 1899530
Text:  the populaous。 and the later black and white。 yeah， i mean， II honestly， can't think of many of those round defining games happening in in recent years。, Start Time: 1916690
Text:  so that's that's what really intrigued me。 so i just want to ask you。 so。 so how did you get this idea of playing god in the first place？, Start Time: 1927830
Text:  and like， is it because just a hunch， like like you， you think it's just just your fun。 so or you realize that there there must be some psychological logic or some element deep there that make this kind of god game popular。, Start Time: 1938210
Text:  and this well received。 yeah， i've been to start off with in popupuses， since had had no idea。 okay， just art in journal。 i was just luck，, Start Time: 1956910
Text:  but it was just luck， but it was also this idea of at at will。 and i'm i'm still trying with this。 i'm still thinking about this。, Start Time: 1969530
Text:  i'm still trying to achieve it， what it feels like to to run a hot of world to create a world， which is yours。 yeah， i think is fasfascinthing。, Start Time: 1982480
Text:  yeah， added 在微信，在卫生啊， a couple of stories that i read when i was a child about about， and i coulknoknow the names of them， but they were about the stories about immoral responsibility。, Start Time: 1994010
Text:  so you have something to care about， like， you know， we are， after all， we are all in our lives， gods to our pats， yes， in our lives。, Start Time: 2012290
Text:  and we love the unconditional love that a dog gives us or that they， the individually love， that a cat gives ses。 and so that feeling of having a little world having this world depend upon you。, Start Time: 2024740
Text:  i think it's a really powerful。 yeah， it is are empowerful emotions inside。 and you know， for me， i explored that i found that by accident with goddand，, Start Time: 2041570
Text:  and i explore it much more in black， white and giving it world and a creature that shapititself around the way that you plyer played。, Start Time: 2056400
Text:  and i think it's still a very fascinating um a fascinating set， a feelings that pulls it out。 yeah， if we go， the last question is，, Start Time: 2066640
Text:  if i said， you know， this this world depends on you。 yeah， it's worwordd's going to suffer。 if you're not not there， how does that make you feel now？, Start Time: 2078255
Text:  sometimes that make kes you feel angry and you feel like you， we know just do do yourourself， you know you， you feel like giving destruction tions these other people。, Start Time: 2090120
Text:  yeah， but sometimes it may kes。 well， i'm you know， i'm going to really， you know， i'm going to really spend some time with by little world。, Start Time: 2100430
Text:  i think it's a sense of a responsibility， and sometimes that becomes like way too heavy。 but sometimes it just it brings you in and gives give you this sense of a sacred responsibility。, Start Time: 2109170
Text:  you think， yes， or also， it's a great source of humor。 yes， your day。 and the for me， the best humor is the human， or you discover yourself。, Start Time: 2123030
Text:  so in in in black white ite， black and white case you， you could you could， you know you could be very cruel to your crecreature。, Start Time: 2132975
Text:  you could be cruel to your villalages， but it be that it was quite funny y well well。 so ah watwatch and to realizze that this human bethat as well，, Start Time: 2145840
Text:  i think it's fascinate。 i watch ch your tetetax talk about perpercentage behaviour。 but in black and white， but there be be very rurulike like a very good god，, Start Time: 2154940
Text:  but theyalways like five or ten percent people， but that very true。 so in black and white case， and so true in faabgood case， is that most and i never looked to the figures for china，, Start Time: 2170360
Text:  otherwise， because they're very， very different in americamericto， be different to british people。 there were different to spanish people different to german people。, Start Time: 2184510
Text:  i never saw the tistics for chinese people， but i was very， very upset that most people， the majority people were just too nice。, Start Time: 2194160
Text:  and and that， that always， that always， i know。 so when i was designing those to the games and i'm actually doing a game where there is a moment，, Start Time: 2207015
Text:  there is a lot of morality in the game。 yeah， i'm really i'm really making sure that there is a real temptation do not always be temptation is as a persal fascinating prospect。, Start Time: 2219490
Text:  yeah， so so letalk about the dununon keeper。 that was a that was a brilliant brilliant game。 i mean， many of my my friends 's in in love with with it for a long time，, Start Time: 2234210
Text:  including me。 so i find there's this uh consistence， like like you always tend to think in the reversed angle， like like you don't want to always be uh by the hero side，, Start Time: 2244370
Text:  like you are a hero， and i you defeed the monsers you， you think。 so。 so what about i am the world or i am the village， or i am the dunnkeeper per and you what happto them them and what you ing janinthings thing meeven。, Start Time: 2262220
Text:  it's very really clear to many people， people that that。 so um i don't i don't see many of the successors。 i mean， people they really tried very hard to do similar things like your work，, Start Time: 2279640
Text:  but i don't see the defeed really succeed in that way。 so what what you feel， what you make that that and don't know daner keep the idea and dangie you came me，, Start Time: 2293440
Text:  but watching jane on keeper。 and the janeborn films always used a really frustrate because the you know it was always so sad that janes borb would come in and destroy the bad guy。, Start Time: 2304880
Text:  yeah， but this bad guy spent his whole life building this evil basis， and you know， he had， you know， they had ten thousand。 yeah，, Start Time: 2323280
Text:  people they had to employ。 and i was always fasstates about the bad guy， you know， the bad guy， how to how the bad guys。 yeah， how had the employee people，, Start Time: 2333460
Text:  you know， you know， how do you know， come ing work for me？ you may die， and i want to destroy the world。 i yeah， how to how do you get someone yeah，, Start Time: 2344525
Text:  to what you， if you're a bad guy， and that always fascinated me。 so um i'm was ininking of doing again， then doesn't keep a idea of why did we get you to play the bag？, Start Time: 2355280
Text:  y， all the you know， these heroes？ yeah， they i'm ving in try to steal。 you're treasure ing。 you know， you gottta hide it down in in estnan。, Start Time: 2369150
Text:  yeah， and it was such a fun game to make。 yeah， it was a fun game to make。 and we we made it。 it was just seven people that made hundred people。, Start Time: 2378809
Text:  and and we really， you know， we really work hard， but really ve doing ing it。 it was was was al， a real joy。 a lot of the mechanics stdondanky became in very，, Start Time: 2389880
Text:  very late。 um you know， the imms that used to dig out the engine that only really happens right towards the end of development。, Start Time: 2403130
Text:  when that utor the way that i explore new ideas is to take an idea and to run with the idea， not to do a big design document and say，, Start Time: 2414090
Text:  right？ and i know where everything that are we're going to do to develop this is but implement one feature， see how that feels the influence another feature，, Start Time: 2429140
Text:  the inmluenence another feature。 and then then you were more exploring developing again me rather than 嗯嗯 lether n developing all up front。, Start Time: 2440000
Text:  yeah， there's me example。 i gufty is is no。 i feel it's like， yeah， making rational game is if i am， if i have a um like in the in the eighteen century，, Start Time: 2451970
Text:  one thousand nine hundred teen century， there were a lot of western explorerthat would explore places like africa and america， and they would try and discover，, Start Time: 2470530
Text:  you know， new things like they had。 there was a famous explore that tried to find the source of the rebanilil。 and when they set out on to explore something，, Start Time: 2483390
Text:  they didn't know how long they would be exploring for。 they just said to themselves。 we want to find the source of the nile， and i think，, Start Time: 2495090
Text:  making an innovtional gaames like that。 yeah， for me， you know， dungeing keeper was simple。 i want to play the bad guy。 i want to play the the guy，, Start Time: 2504120
Text:  whose in charge of the duner， the design and then that we the seven of us set out to explore that idea。 and i think that way， you is much more likely，, Start Time: 2513970
Text:  you will end up with a game that never existed before。 now the alternative is i'm going to do a game about um i'm going to do a first person on shooter，, Start Time: 2528640
Text:  and it's going to have these features。 it's going to have。 it's it's going to have fast gun switching。 it's going to be sit on the moon。, Start Time: 2539680
Text:  what you're doing there is not exploring your implement， and that's a very different way of discovering of his entertaining。 yeah。, Start Time: 2549875
Text:  so dlcan keep the with the porest form of innovational development that i've ever ever ever done anything。 and we started out with this with this。, Start Time: 2560110
Text:  okay。 how would it feel to be the bad guy who mans the dunine？ now？ we ended up with a dungeon ww that actually comes align with what i imagine in your place that i would think，, Start Time: 2570840
Text:  and i would do so。 let's talk about the actual well， what ah， yeah， yeah。 it's it's a very scary thing today。 yeah， i don't think it's very practical。, Start Time: 2585600
Text:  i mean， if you give um this sort of advice to younger game developers， i mean， yeah， the ozard wwon't。 i think of the problem is，, Start Time: 2597760
Text:  is the team， you know， because you say to really what you're saying is like the explorer is your saying you're saying， okay， this is an amazing game。, Start Time: 2607640
Text:  we're going to make a promost brbrilligame me ever。 and and just follow me this week， we'll make it this way。 yeah。 and then after a while，, Start Time: 2620790
Text:  the team will turn runs where we've been making this game for year now， and it's not brilliant。 so you know， you know something it。, Start Time: 2629870
Text:  it's very scary to develop。 well， yeah， yeah， oh my god。 so um so what are you like when you um work like， are you a very detail oriented person like you？, Start Time: 2638760
Text:  uh， you get to tell them exactly what what to do for every detail or you're enjoy throwing ideas to your team and let and let them figure it out。, Start Time: 2651900
Text:  it's another one of things is finding the right team yeah。 and the perfect team is a team that works well together and works well with me。, Start Time: 2662640
Text:  my my， i much prefer saying to someone like a codo and artist。 it's pretty a codo and artist。 okay， this is the thing we want to try and do。, Start Time: 2676000
Text:  i'm not going to tell you how to to do it。 i'm not going to tell you completely all， but all the pieces over。 i'm not going to give you an an exact design document。, Start Time: 2687015
Text:  i'm going to let you you own it。 yeah。 i'm going to let you own it and care about it， and i'm going to make i'm going going。 i'm going to say to you at the end，, Start Time: 2699150
Text: 那边嗯 you， it should be your best work and allowing people to express their own creativity within a small idea， their own passion and their own dedication to an idea。, Start Time: 2710270
Text:  i think he's essential right， the most intriat people like robots and say， right。 this is what you're going to draw。 this is what you're going to draw。, Start Time: 2725200
Text:  this is less creative approach。 you， you say， because we 're like a collaboration of people who love new idea。 that's that's what i think is the most as interesting。, Start Time: 2734700
Text:  but sometimes， you know what you're describing， someone is so difficult to despry it it it。 it is like the trail， the backpack on the trail，, Start Time: 2750540
Text:  when you picks up off up and putting the backpack。 yeah， that was didifficult to dedescribe because it was， you know， II kept sanow。, Start Time: 2764690
Text:  it doesn't feel like like backackackket doesn't。 so。 so in end and i'd it look， let me have a try a programming the backpack myself。, Start Time: 2773130
Text:  so sometimes i'll do some coding myself， because to really inspire people about how things should feel。 wow。 okay， at the moment。, Start Time: 2783410
Text:  um i'm doing some coding on。 i can't tell you what what it on。 but reason doing ing coding is what what i'm doing is。 so hard to put down in a in a presentation or a deck。, Start Time: 2799030
Text:  so and i consending if your readers would be interested， and i can send some oon documents that i'll redo。 and and you'll see that they're very picicorally base。, Start Time: 2812550
Text:  so ow， i'm h that goes off to you。 oh， i'm math。 they talk about。 okay， this is the i this is very picctory place feel。 and this is how this is how i'm the mechanic should work。, Start Time: 2825310
Text:  but you you know， it's it's much more loose than giving people a natural great。 yeah， well， that， that sounds just wonderful and uh，, Start Time: 2841270
Text:  very much against the best practice of gaming industry。 it sounds like very dangerous， and it could be very ineffective。 so so um and debrous。, Start Time: 2852670
Text:  and so it could be， i would say is that you have to have a someone with the passion and the energy and the enthusiasm to make sure that every separate of way，, Start Time: 2866050
Text:  yeah， people， people， len things are doing are taking the right direction， because what what you can't be lalazit， you can't say someone，, Start Time: 2881240
Text:  okay， you know， you going do this future。 yeah， that's what i don't have think about that anymore。 yeah， you really have to make encourage them and you really have to check on them or almost almost every every day，, Start Time: 2890400
Text:  because what you this is always being through every day。 we meet as a team。 we in faabor when it is very large， we used to have some teams，, Start Time: 2904820
Text:  but we meet the team and we talk about， but this is what this is have what we're doing with an idea。 so you if you if you just leave something to to to to evolve on its own，, Start Time: 2916440
Text:  it's not never going to work。 you have to you have to be a shepherd with ideas。 yeah， and you you have to guide those ideas in correct one activity。, Start Time: 2929620
Text:  yeah。 so so that brings us to uh uh， a hard question， like um when i look into the history uh of your career， uh， there was this weird cycle thing like you think um found a great start up with doing great work with your partners。, Start Time: 2939970
Text:  and then uh， you might with some difficulty。 and yeah， actually， uh it's so to uh a huge company， and then it gets even bigger and more difficulty。, Start Time: 2958880
Text:  and sometimes people get bored， and sometimes you get bored， and then you quit and become independent again or yeah。 so my question is like，, Start Time: 2969980
Text:  do you think think keepit and and independent is crucicial crecreating great games， or you just don't like keepment and being a executive of a huge uh，, Start Time: 2980460
Text:  so and acacyou know the again， every every time i been acquired by by by a ananor electronic cards and microsoft。 yeah， it felt like the right thing to do at the time，, Start Time: 2995160
Text:  feel like absolutely the right thing to get the time。 it was the right thing to do for myself right thing to do for the games that we were making and the right thing to do for a new near the future。, Start Time: 3009330
Text:  and if it wasn't for eleelecticcards ds ying bullfrog， there would be no theme hospital。 and there would be no dominity。 yeah。嗯，, Start Time: 3022190
Text:  but there are these moments in my life。 and the the last moment， when i left liandhead， i blame completely on me watching the steve jobs video。, Start Time: 3032420
Text:  when the iphone was in it， what 很贵， because II saw， i saw him touch that phone。 and when he touched that screen， yeah， i immotially thought this is what it's going to fine game。, Start Time: 3048100
Text:  yeah at this。 and i memeditely thought this gonna make hundreds of million of millions of people game ers and it this is exactly what happened。, Start Time: 3064950
Text:  yes。 and the problem was that i was part of microsoft。 yes， and much soofved wanted absolutely wanted me to make fapor。 yeah， that's what they want to do is to make favor one，, Start Time: 3077240
Text:  favor two table， three table four， and they wanted me to make games for the x box。 yeah。 and at that time， i thought， myself， you know what？, Start Time: 3092250
Text: 哎， i i'm so passionate about this that i'm willing to give up。 i had a fabulous job at micsoft。 icrosoft is a wonderful amazing company。, Start Time: 3101925
Text:  yes。 and and i would have properly been a in a very senior position amount soft。 and i thought of matther， i could need ther do that。, Start Time: 3114510
Text:  or if the i could i could i could develop games for this device for people that have never play games before。 yeah， you just don't know what is getting up。, Start Time: 3125770
Text:  he？ i'm you know， i'm i began so obsessed with that idea that i left him phone once two cams。 now， in bulffrox case， it was kind of a similar story in way。, Start Time: 3136030
Text:  in that， you know， theme park and thing hospital were very successful。 and denyou people was very successful。 and i had this idea that you know what AI developing AIN gained that has to be an opportunity there。, Start Time: 3150200
Text:  yeah， you know， i went to electronic guards and said， you know， i'd love to do this game court。 you know， it wasn't called black white ite，, Start Time: 3170210
Text:  that by the school crecreation， i'd love to do this game coperonzsaid。 well， you know， your studio is two more people。 now。 well，, Start Time: 3179190
Text:  really want you to make some more thing in park and hospital like games， or maybe to make a danant keep it two。 ah maybe because consider as syndically yeand，, Start Time: 3187230
Text:  you know， because they were fascinated about the sek was understandably， yeah， you know， i thought i know about opportby and had i'm going to use this idea of AI in in game。, Start Time: 3197250
Text:  so it's all all all about passionate， passionate about the opportunities that are happening at the moment。 yeah， yeah， i think all teams definitely。, Start Time: 3211430
Text:  i mean， now the fact that matter is that the small team is so much more friendly， well， treamme 的 will fighting together all on this to try and achieve it。, Start Time: 3221450
Text:  but if it's very in now， now， twenty two cans， we have。 we know we've got twenty two people that we use a lot about sourcing people as well，, Start Time: 3233775
Text:  because the amount of people that takes to make a high quality gaames。 it's enormous。 yeah， enenmous states and said， yeah。 and also you just i always think that you may feel like more more comfortable um being with actual designers and uh the programmers instead of being a high rank k extly。, Start Time: 3244940
Text:  ah i do if II feel very comfortable doing that， and i'm am very passionate about doing that in a if with an middle of an idea。 yeah，, Start Time: 3269760
Text:  absolute， yeah。 but i also one of most wonderful things in life is to inspire our people。 ah ah you know know i find that is is is you，, Start Time: 3280380
Text:  you know， equally fascinating， you know there's some great that happened when i was part of microsoft。 and when i was part of microonon cards，, Start Time: 3293280
Text:  but weren't about being being proment of being desigre。 and and those were wonderful moments in my life。 yeah。 and but sometimes if i got an idea of the game in my head and you know it，, Start Time: 3302160
Text:  because i become so focus on passionate on my idea， exthink think， you know， you know， at last night， for example， i just couldn't i couldn't get sleep get。, Start Time: 3315570
Text:  so so i had to get up at three o'clock in the morning， and i had to stoart。 i had stop getting getting this idea in it。 no， i did that for until five o'clock in the morning。, Start Time: 3330100
Text:  and then i went back sped again， and i just have i just i love what i do so much。 i said， it is a it's a wonderful obsection 吧。, Start Time: 3340800
Text:  yeah， well， what's that will happen for very sure to amt the time？ and all of the times， it's 're a great work。 yeah。 well， what can you say？, Start Time: 3352450
Text:  it's， it's just who you are。 so um what is the trail like？ i mean， if you would like to introduce it to to our players in china who have not much of an idea about it。, Start Time: 3361510
Text:  i mean， i went to a lot of trouble to install it on my phone and i'played it for two hours and youa relaxing and very， very relaxed。, Start Time: 3374370
Text:  so it's a relaxing little game。 so it's a very much so very lolot of trouble your tool。 and i love the idea that， no， i well， i'll just i'm just gonna play until i get to see whatever that helill。, Start Time: 3385130
Text:  i'll just play until i see what from the next quarter。 it is definitely design for an audience that wants to escape the world。 yeah，, Start Time: 3404630
Text:  they wanted， you know， for me， a lot of times i play again and just to be stake， just to it can stop。 and it's very relaxing experience。, Start Time: 3414095
Text:  it's designed to be able experiit。 this ofn't also to be an experience where you're looking you're searching for your home， researching for somewhere that you can call home。, Start Time: 3425000
Text:  and that's what you're exploring for is you're searching for that home， that that little town that you're going to set up。 and then you're working with your neighbors in that town to make that town，, Start Time: 3437930
Text:  the best town。 so it's better exploring and it's about bounding and it's about collecting and crafting， but it's very relaxing and very soviy。, Start Time: 3452520
Text:  yeah。 so II love that。 so i saw bit because i knew that i was designing at this game for people who maybe have played match three games or maybe have played maybe have play world build games。, Start Time: 3462740
Text:  and i'm to really designed it for those those people because， but i noticed that those people do is they they most if they play these games on train。, Start Time: 3479000
Text:  and you know， well， the hope a whole world is going on around and they're down over their games。 they love that escape ism。 et was there's re's。, Start Time: 3489045
Text:  extrail is about exploring and crafting trading with other people， making stuff and finding a home somewhere to your home and then know working together with your neighbors to make that the best loop out time。, Start Time: 3498410
Text:  yeah， but it's also a different different from many work previously。 you did。 and it's a it's a mobile game。 so that must be a real challenge for you and twenty counts。, Start Time: 3514350
Text:  it is a challenge。 i mean， the 第一， would the first sites in think about mobile？ is that that those challenges 啊嗯 changing very quickly。, Start Time: 3526450
Text:  because now what world game is on mobile， who were very unique experience are now becoming much more experience。 now yep， and now they have now it，, Start Time: 3541020
Text:  you know， we have got hundreds of millions of people who acaccepting goh chengenges games， ames and who are doing quite difficult challengge himself。, Start Time: 3551740
Text:  and i find that absolutely fascinating for many mobile is a very internal device and love the fact that with mobile。 it's it's a gaining device that people always have with with，, Start Time: 3561960
Text:  and that is very， very different than me going somewhere sitting down and playing something。 so it's it's a device， which is is is got support，, Start Time: 3576260
Text:  very quick game sessions。 and support emersing people enough that they relarelax。 yeah， yeah， wow。 uh。 i'm pretty sure that the the players here in china would enjoy it very much。, Start Time: 3588630
Text:  and and you got amazing partners here。 yeah， this is a big， absolute brilliant。 and i've added ded， and they were find the game and maybe a so much more interesting，, Start Time: 3607370
Text:  nothing。 and i'm very impinvest with them。 yeah。 thank you so much。 so uh， the final question here in china， although it's it's still not like a very big game develop community，, Start Time: 3620590
Text:  but there are many new younger game designers。 so what of companies？ so what would you teach or suners ers your experihere， your underunderanding ding this line of anso？, Start Time: 3634740
Text:  what have an idea？ this is my voices， have an idea of an experience if you want to have in a game that hasn't been capplicted and explore the idea with all the passionate energy that you are。, Start Time: 3652880
Text:  so your heart， your mind convert and don't give up， don't know just because the game doesn't feel right at one point and done doesn't mean that，, Start Time: 3672735
Text:  that original idea isn't that because you gonnsee see publish er， they don't sign you up， doesn't mean that your idea isn't right。, Start Time: 3684570
Text:  you've got to fight。 you've got a fight like a parent fights for his troul。 with your idea is like the young baby， and you are like a parent，, Start Time: 3692710
Text:  and you have to take that idea like a parent， takes a child and nurchasen rois。 if you gota take that idea nurure and grow it and develop it until it becomes amazing and credible。, Start Time: 3704890
Text:  and then you can sit about and compare that original idea you had with what your fun again。 me。 yeah， that's inbiring。 well， thank you so much。, Start Time: 3719470
Text:  it's a great honor for us to speak to you。 II hope。 we have some more time to talk。 uh some other time。 so uh， just good luck with the game in everything，, Start Time: 3730780
Text:  and i hope i read your biography， but much later this， and i hope you never retire。 and i don't always curious and always wonder with your network。, Start Time: 3740520
Text:  when are you be found deps on my keyboards， you know， that is him perfectly to do。 thank you so much。 thank you。 thank you。 thank you so much。, Start Time: 3751875
Text: 赛罗奥特曼，我说天程绪万载。, Start Time: 3764625
